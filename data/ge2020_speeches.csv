2020-06-23,People's Action Party,Lee Hsien Loong,GE2020 announcement,"Earlier today, I saw President Halimah Yacob, to advise her to dissolve Parliament and issue the Writ of Election. Let me explain why I have decided to call the general election now.

We are approaching the end of the five-year term of this Government. Under the Constitution, elections must be held at the latest by April 2021. That is less than a year away.

COVID-19
We have been fully occupied with the COVID-19 outbreak since the beginning of the year. The pandemic set upon the world suddenly. It quickly grew into a global crisis, spreading across many countries. Around the world, nearly half a million people have died, and countless more have seen their lives disrupted.

Singapore detected our first cases in January. At first, most were imported cases. But soon we observed a growing number of local cases, with no links to infected visitors. In March the numbers grew, especially later when COVID-19 started spreading among migrant workers in dormitories.

We responded decisively. We imposed a circuit breaker for two months. We made strenuous efforts to care for our migrant workers. In the dormitories, we are making steady progress, though it will take a few more months to resolve the problem. At the same time, new community cases have come down sharply. Most importantly, we have kept the number of fatalities very low. Right now, we only have one patient in the ICU in hospital.

Still, the virus has taken a heavy toll on livelihoods. Around the world, the lockdowns and the public health measures have caused a deep economic crisis. In Singapore, we have mitigated this with massive fiscal action. We passed four Budgets, injecting almost $100 billion. We are drawing from our reserves to support workers, businesses and households. These decisive emergency actions have kept retrenchments and company closures low. They have helped Singaporeans take care of their families and see through the immediate crisis.

After great effort, we are now in a stable position. We are cautiously resuming social activities, and progressively reviving our economy. Life can now become more normal than it was during the circuit breaker, provided we all continue to take the precautions seriously.

But we should be under no illusions that we have defeated COVID-19. This is just the end of the beginning phase. A long struggle lies ahead.

COVID-19 will be with us for at least a year and most probably longer, until a vaccine is developed and becomes available. It is a very difficult and tricky disease to deal with. So we have to continue keeping a close watch on the situation. Many other countries have successfully brought their cases down, only to experience fresh outbreaks after opening up again. E.g. South Korea (from nightspots in Itaewon in Seoul), China (from a market in Beijing), Germany (in an abattoir), the US (in the southern Sun Belt states). Therefore, we must be psychologically prepared for more ups and downs in this fight against COVID-19.

Economically, we must brace ourselves for a very tough period ahead. Singapore has not yet felt the full economic fallout from COVID-19, but it is coming. Despite all the measures we have taken, there will be more business closures, and more retrenchments in the coming months. Unemployment will go up.

But we are determined to save as many jobs as we can, and create new jobs too. And we will do our utmost to help businesses and industries survive and restructure themselves. That is how we can keep our capabilities and livelihoods intact through the storm, and pick up again when the sun shines once more.

COVID-19, the economy and jobs are domestic concerns. But we also face external uncertainties. Major regional and global developments can affect us. US-China tensions over many issues, now including Hong Kong. The US presidential elections in November. Border clashes between China and India. Political developments nearer home in Southeast Asia. We do not know what surprises may be in store for us within the next year. But as dangers materialise, we must navigate safely through them and protect Singapore’s security and national interests. And this will require diplomatic skills and a deft touch.

To overcome these challenges, we must stand completely united as one people. Singaporeans and the Government must work closely together, with full trust and confidence in each other. The Government must be able to respond promptly and decisively to the COVID-19 outbreak and the economic situation, and to external developments. We need a capable Government, with the strong backing of the people, to do all that needs to be done on your behalf, and see us through these tumultuous times.

Elections
An election now – when things are relatively stable – will clear the decks, and give the new Government a fresh, full, five-year mandate. It can then focus on this national agenda and the difficult decisions it will have to make and to carry. The alternative is to wait out the COVID-19 pandemic. But we have no assurance that the pandemic will be over before this Government’s term must end next April. And this is why I have decided to hold the General Election now.

We are still in the midst of COVID-19, so it will not be a normal election campaign. Before deciding to proceed, I had to be certain of two things. First, that voters can vote safely. Second, that political parties can campaign effectively. After studying the issues, I am satisfied that both of these can be done.

On voter safety, the Elections Department will be implementing additional precautions on Polling Day. We are setting up more polling stations than in previous elections, to reduce crowding. There will be safe distancing measures practiced at the polling stations. Voters will be allocated specific time slots to vote, and seniors will be given priority to vote before others.

On effective campaigning, the Elections Department has also made arrangements and issued guidelines. Candidates can still go house-to-house campaigning in person, provided they observe the safe distancing precautions. Unfortunately, physical election rallies will not be possible, but we will make up with more opportunities for candidates to speak directly to voters on television, and of course online, for example via live streaming.

Singapore is not the first to hold an election during COVID-19. Others have done so too: South Korea, Taiwan and several European countries. With our arrangements and precautions in place, I am confident we can hold a proper and safe election.

Governing
During the election period, the Government will continue to govern. The Cabinet remains in charge even after Parliament is dissolved. The public service will function normally. This is so in every General Election. But I particularly emphasise this now, because of the vital importance of ongoing operations against COVID-19, sustaining the economy and protecting jobs. Therefore, over the next few weeks, you can expect the Ministerial Task Force still to lead our response to COVID-19. On the economic front, the National Jobs Council will create jobs and training places. Businesses, workers and families will receive help and support. All this essential work, on your behalf, will go on uninterrupted throughout the election period.

Conclusion
This General Election will be like no other that we have experienced. Not just because of the special arrangements to deal with COVID-19, but because of the gravity of the situation, and the issues at stake. The government that you elect will have critical decisions to make. These decisions will impact your lives and livelihoods, and shape Singapore for many years to come, far beyond the five-year term of the next government.

Soon, you will have the chance to decide whom to entrust with the responsibility of working with you to take our country forward. I have every confidence that you will think carefully, and vote wisely, to secure our lives, our jobs, and our future. ",https://www.pmo.gov.sg/Newsroom/Speech-on-GE2020-by-PM-Lee-Hsien-Loong
2020-06-24,Progress Singapore Party,Lee Hsien Yang,FB post,"Election fever is in the air.

The coming General Election will be a watershed. There will be no LKY Bonus or SG 50 to help the ruling party. And there are a number of live issues which are of broad concern including the CPF scheme, HDB leases and the Presidential Election widely perceived to lack legitimacy. 

I would like to leave you with 3 thoughts: Firstly, the PAP has lost its way. My sister Weiling shares this view too. In fact she said so in a Facebook post in August 2016 before ""Oxleygate"". The current government is distinctly different from when LKY was PM and subsequently MM. 

Secondly, it is possible to be loyal Singaporeans. To be proud of what has been accomplished in the past, to recite with pride “we the citizens of Singapore”. To love Singapore, and yet to not vote PAP.
 
Finally, the Progress Singapore Party and Dr Tan needs our help. We can contribute in many different ways. We can volunteer to help with a myriad of tasks that the party needs to deal with, to contest the GE. We can help to spread the word. Persuade our friends and family that the PSP is a serious party that deserves their support. 

And last but not least, we can give generously to help ensure PSP has adequate financial resources to mount a serious challenge. Together, our strong support of the PSP can make a better future for Singapore.",https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1731900436976261
2020-06-25,Workers' Party,Pritam Singh,FB post,"I would like to announce that Mr Low Thia Khiang, Mr Chen Show Mao and Mr Png Eng Huat would not be standing as candidates in GE2020. The party leadership came to this collective decision with Mr Low, Mr Chen and Mr Png some time ago, when all three shared their wish to step down at the end of the current term of Parliament. 

However, their decision to step down is not a retirement. The collective decision is based on three considerations, all of which are anchored on the continued political success of The Workers' Party.

First, broaden the leadership base. For the Party to grow, new and younger leaders require Parliamentary and Town Council experience. If there is no renewal of Workers’ Party MPs, over time, the Party will not be able to attract new members to join and aspire to serve Singapore and Singaporeans as opposition MPs. The absence of new blood will set the Party back in its growth as a credible and institutionalized opposition in Singapore.

Two, mentorship and training. As the Party grows, it is important to ensure that a cadre of individuals can provide mentorship and training to younger leaders. The time is right for the Workers’ Party to have senior leaders contribute in a different capacity. They remain critical as the Party's resource of information and experience.

Thirdly, staying in touch with Singapore. The above two, were reasons that Mr Low and I agreed on. But I took some time to reflect on the third reason before I was eventually persuaded.

Mr Low shared with me that it was critical for the Workers’ Party to remain relevant to all Singaporeans, be they new citizens, seniors, middle-aged and younger voters. He was concerned that as the elder generation of the Party ages, even as values and wisdom remain timeless, an MP must have his or her pulse on Singapore society.

If a Workers’ Party MP became too detached from new norms and the changing shape of society, the Workers’ Party would be less effective in speaking for Singaporeans in Parliament and run the risk of becoming irrelevant.

The Workers’ Party and our supporters have been fortunate to count on the leadership of Mr Low, Mr Chen and Mr Png for many years, and many Singaporeans are in their debt for their decision to serve the country through the Workers’ Party. 

For the upcoming elections, Gerald Giam and Leon Perera, both experienced NCMPs will stand in Aljunied GRC, and the Party Organising Secretary Dennis Tan, another NCMP, will stand in Hougang SMC.

The party leadership, and all of us at The Workers’ Party will continue working and walking together, standing on the shoulders of the values Mr Low and other elder members have built. We will strengthen and carry the Workers’ Party forward to greater heights.",https://www.facebook.com/pritam.eunos/posts/3237207909634833?__tn__=K-R
2020-06-27,People's Action Party,Lee Hsien Loong,Launch of PAP manifesto,"We are going into elections in the midst of a global crisis. The Covid-19 pandemic has affected many lives and livelihoods. After great effort, we have stabilised the situation in Singapore. Now we are resuming some activities and reopening our economy, cautiously, but our work is only just beginning.

The next government has a huge task ahead. It will have many important decisions to make, decisions that will affect our lives for years to come.

This is why I have called the general election now. It is to give Singapore a new government, a government with a full five-year term ahead of it and a fresh mandate from voters, a government which can focus on the urgent problems and deal decisively with them.

A different General Election
Today, the PAP is launching our manifesto for the general election. In a normal election, our manifesto would focus on all our long-term ideas to improve and transform Singapore - projects like the Tuas Megaport and Changi Terminal 5, development plans for the Greater Southern Waterfront and Jurong Lake District, more and better pre-schools, healthcare for the elderly, preparing for climate change.

All these plans are ambitious, but credible, because generation after generation, we have never stopped building on what we inherited in Singapore.

And also, because election after election, PAP governments have never failed to deliver on our promises to the people.

In normal elections, what is usually of much less interest to voters is the routine business of keeping Singapore going.

Singaporeans expect everything to continue running smoothly, and the PAP to continue to govern properly, before and after the election. They are confident the country will stay safe, our health services will continue to run, the economy will keep humming along, and jobs will always be available.

In other countries, this would be heroic, even reckless assumptions to make, but in Singapore, they are quite realistic, and have become the expectation and the norm.

But this time is different. This is not a normal election, and we are not in a normal situation.

We are in the middle of the most severe crisis in the world, that the world has faced for many decades. The immediate business of running Singapore is anything but routine.

Without a Herculean effort by us, we cannot be certain that what we have painstakingly built over decades will continue to stand, and not collapse in the storm.

Right now, keeping Singapore going, flying straight and level, safely through the turbulent weather is the most challenging and urgent priority for the Government.

Therefore, the central focus of this manifesto is how we will work together to overcome this crisis of a generation.

How we will keep Singaporeans and our migrant workers safe, and prevent Covid-19 from overwhelming our healthcare system and hospitals, how we will restart and transform the economy, save jobs and businesses, and reskill workers to take on new jobs, how we will provide care and support to one another, so that together we can keep ourselves all of us safe amidst the uncertainties and dangers.

These issues are at the top of people's minds.

Singaporeans understand that this is not business as usual, or politics as usual. You want to know how the Government will work with you to solve your pressing worries.

This manifesto - Our Lives, Our Jobs, Our Future - answers your questions.

Longer term plans
Beyond Covid-19 and jobs, Singaporeans will also want to know what longer-term future you can look forward to. Where will Singapore be, in five, 10, 20 years' time?

After the crisis passes, can Singapore resume our journey, onward and upward?

So this manifesto also sets out the PAP's longer-term plans to build a better Singapore, because our aim is not just to survive the storm, but also to maintain the long-term direction for the country, and keep on building and improving Singapore.

This is the manifesto of a responsible party and government. Singaporeans can rely on the PAP government, both to address your immediate needs, and also to work with you to secure your long-term future.

What the PAP promises, the PAP will deliver.

PAP Team
To put this manifesto into action, we need the full support of Singaporeans.

We also need a strong, steady and capable leadership team - a team with experience who've been through previous crises, who know what to do, what resources are at your disposal, and what pitfalls and traps to watch out for, a team with young faces and new ideas who can look at old problems from fresh perspectives, and come up with better solutions, and a dedicated and committed team who have a heart for people and a willingness to listen and who are determined to serve and to do their best for Singapore.

Hardly ever before has government been so crucial to protecting lives and livelihoods of Singaporeans. This is why leadership is key.

Whom you choose to form the next government and the quality of that leadership, is absolutely critical.

But even the best leadership team is only as strong as the support it gets. So we must fight hard to convince Singaporeans that our PAP team is their team, and deserves their full support.

New Candidates
In this general election, we have made an exceptional effort to put together such a national team.

We are fielding 27 new candidates this time - more than a quarter of our total slate, and more than in any previous election. They have all been introduced over the last few days.

But actually, most of them were already familiar to many residents, because they have been working on the ground for some time. Quite a few have been grassroots leaders and party activists for several years now.

We also have a good mix: entrepreneurs, businessmen and women, lawyers, social workers, public servants and SAF officers. And we have more women this time, 10 new candidates are female - double the last round - including our first female SAF general.

Individually, each of the new candidates brings something different to the team. They are each proven in their respective fields and professions.

One of them co-founded a restaurant business, which eventually expanded into an entertainment and F&B company especially popular with younger Singaporeans.

Another is currently vice-president at an aerospace company. He came back to Singapore to lead a major project, after many years working in the UK and Europe.

But beyond ability and performance, the new candidates, just like the older ones, also have a strong commitment to serving people.

Several have founded social enterprises and non-profit organisations.

We also have former civil servants who led the Pioneer Generation Office, which has now become the Silver Generation Office, and the People's Association.

Several of the candidates have taken harder roads to success. Two grew up in rental flats, another two came up through the Normal (Academic) stream and went on to polytechnic. One later earned a PhD and is now back in the polytechnic, teaching, nurturing the next generation. The other one worked as a paralegal before saving enough to pursue a law degree overseas. And now she's a lawyer, and continues to give back, setting up legal clinics in the community.

In fact, altogether five of the new candidates are polytechnic diploma graduates.

Having succeeded, they are now helping others to succeed too.

The PAP has made it a fundamental goal to open up many paths to success in Singapore.

Regardless of your family background, if you work hard, you can progress and make a good life for yourselves.

Our candidates know this is true - they've made it happen in their own lives. They have lived the Singapore story.

I am proud of our candidates individually. But what I am most proud of is that collectively, the new candidates represent a wide range of life experiences and backgrounds.

This is what makes the PAP the mainstream party in Singapore - a broad tent that occupies the middle ground, and represents the vast majority of Singaporeans.

Our new candidates come from all walks of life, and they are representative of the complexion of our society. And if elected, they will become your representatives in Parliament.

Because they are like you, they understand you and your concerns, and they care for you.

You can trust them to speak up on your behalf, and to work closely with you to find good solutions for you and for Singapore.

Because of time, I am not able to speak in detail about all the new candidates one by one but we have made a short video so that you can put faces to the names, and know who all of them are.

Comrades, Brothers and Sisters, I present to you the new PAP candidates for GE2020.

Opposition ward candidates
The new candidates will soon face the cut and thrust of electoral politics. It will be a big step, probably a little out of their comfort zones. But they will get used to it, and some may even in time, relish it.

But in any election, the candidates with the most challenging task are the ones standing in opposition wards, in Hougang SMC and Aljunied GRC.

In 2015, our candidates fought extremely hard and performed very well. In Hougang, Lee Hong Chuang improved the PAP's vote share to 42 per cent.

In Aljunied, Victor Lye's GRC team did well enough to demand a recount of the votes.

Ever since then, the PAP teams have been hard at work on the ground in Hougang and in Aljunied. Now they are ready to contest again, this time wiser, more experienced, and having formed deeper bonds with the residents.

I hope Hougang and Aljunied voters will give them a chance to show what they can do.

To our Hougang and Aljunied team, and to all our candidates wherever you will be standing: we support you fully, and we wish you all the best!

MPs Retiring
In every election as we field new candidates, so we also have MPs who are retiring. This year, about 20 MPs are retiring.

One of them is the Deputy Speaker, Charles Chong. Of all the PAP MPs, Charles probably has experienced the narrowest winning margins in elections. In 2011 he won in Joo Chiat with 51 per cent of the vote. In 2015, he took back Punggol East with 52 per cent of the vote.

Always by the skin of his teeth, not because he is a weak MP, but because when there is a tough fight, and we need a strong candidate who will fight hard and fight smart, we send in Charles Chong. And every time, Charles has delivered.

Khaw Boon Wan is retiring too. I published my valedictory letter to him yesterday.

But what makes Boon Wan special is not something that can be easily put down in any letter. Boon Wan has been in all my Cabinets from day one when I became PM. We have fought and won many battles together.

The warmth and mutual regard we have for each other has grown over many years as we worked together, dealing with the spikiest of problems. Ours is an exceptional comradeship that one is sometimes privileged to experience when we commit ourselves to public service.

What I say of Boon Wan applies even more to ESM Goh Chok Tong. ESM Goh too is retiring at this election.

This marks a major transition point for Singapore politics. ESM has served Singapore with great distinction, 44 years as an MP for Marine Parade, and 14 years as Prime Minister.

He has touched the lives of so many Singaporeans, and given his all in service of our country and people.

Personally, I owe ESM Goh a huge debt of gratitude, because he was the one who brought me into politics, and has guided and mentored me all these years, even after I succeeded him as PM.

I do not have time to thank all the retiring MPs one by one today. Each one has served Singapore and the Party loyally. And I have no doubt that if they were to contest the coming GE, many of them would put up a strong showing.

But they have agreed to step down, because they understand the need for self-renewal, and have put the party and nation before themselves.

So after the general election, we will create the appropriate occasion to properly express our deep appreciation to them.

Conclusion
Comrades, today we launch our party manifesto. On Tuesday, the general election campaign starts.

We're going into battle, to win the mandate of the people in a crucial contest.

Make no mistake - this will be a tough election. Singaporeans have lost jobs, families have suffered, many are hurting from the pandemic. We cannot take any vote for granted.

The Singaporean voter is a tough judge. We must fight hard for every single vote, in every single constituency - PAP or opposition, SMC or GRC.

But after winning the people's mandate, we will have a much bigger fight: To protect our people's lives and livelihoods during this deep crisis.

And beyond that, to fight year after year, to keep Singapore successful and special for this and future generations.

These battles can only be won if the PAP has the full support of Singaporeans, and Singapore has the strongest and most committed leadership team to take our nation forward.

Let us give it our all. Convince Singaporeans to give the PAP their strong support, and to work with us to secure our lives, our jobs, and our future.",https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/singapore-ge2020-pm-lee-hsien-loongs-full-speech-at-launch-of-pap-manifesto
2020-06-29,Progress Singapore Party,Lee Hsien Yang,,"SINGAPORE WANTS DIFFERENT
Singaporeans will have to go out to vote on 10 July when they would have preferred to stay safe from the risk of getting COVID-19. Almost three months after lockdown began, new cases still remain stubbornly in the three-digit range, a result of the PAP’s poor handling of the pandemic. The resulting economic damage could have been avoided.

Retired senior civil servant Philip Yeo once put it bluntly: the government is suffering from ‘Eunuch Disease’. There are no leaders that possess the spark, only ‘paper shufflers’ who ‘exist to keep the emperor happy’.

Conflicts of interest are rampant throughout government. PAP leaders and MPs are related or very closely associated to key persons all over - at Temasek, the Auditor-general, the Attorney-general to name a few. There is so much “ownself check ownself”.

There is only narrow group-think that prevails in today’s PAP government, lacking rigour in discussion and debate on policies that shape our country. Singapore has suffered greatly as a result and people are angry and frustrated.

In this COVID-19 election, the people of Singapore must seek accountability. We must vote for change. We must create a first-world parliament to strengthen the DNA of collective leadership in Singapore. We need to vote for our future and for our children’s future, and not for past PAP glories. There are many men and women, old and young, of considerable calibre, passion and compassion in the alternative line-up who can help build a stronger, better Singapore.

I have been privileged to meet some of them, and I know they will bring the diversity that we so desperately need. A truly diverse parliament is a win for the people of Singapore.

This election is our opportunity to end the status quo of the supermajority. We can have our voices heard in Parliament. The PAP is no longer listening. The PAP vision of meritocracy has become a fiction. Instead of space to grow and prosper, our citizens are slowly suffocating from fear and stress. Singapore has become a country where we have very little say in how we live. There is little space in Singapore to be what we want to be, to say what we want to say, to grow, to prosper.

Many Singaporeans feel they are running a rat race in a maze designed by the government, which decides who to dispense rewards to. The chosen few are given a nice big slice of cake. For those who are not scholars or generals or privileged, there are only crumbs.

In this maze, the PAP government of today can create dead-ends, move walls, close off the exits. It can wield POFMA to silence, and defamation suits to ruin and bankrupt, those who disagree. It can choose to retain a long outdated discriminatory law. It can prosecute a single person for an illegal public assembly. Indeed, during Covid-19, it is investigating 2 young persons who separately stood up in public on concerns about climate change.

The PAP can change the Constitution and deny Singaporeans a chance to elect the president. It can do this because the PAP has an overwhelming majority of the seats in Parliament.

It can crush HDB owners’ dreams. It can sit on CPF savings. It can hike GST at will to raise revenue for a government that has undisclosed billions in secret reserves. It can expose us to the risk of COVID-19 by prioritising politics over our lives. It can dismiss the risk of infection in crowded dormitories for foreign workers.

When decisions produce poor results, the government can selectively use statistics and surveys designed to trivialise our fears, and imply that our concerns are unfounded. It can baldly tell us, “In Singapore, no one will be left to walk his journey alone.”

When he ascended to become Prime Minister in 2004, Lee Hsien Loong promised.“We will continue to expand the space which Singaporeans have to live, to laugh, to grow and to be ourselves. Our people should feel free to express diverse views, pursue unconventional ideas, or simply be different. We should have the confidence to engage in robust debate, so as to understand our problems, conceive fresh solutions, and open up new spaces,” “Ours must be an open and inclusive Singapore.”

He has not kept his word. Singapore should not be a maze where people are denied a say in how the country’s riches are shared, where those who struggle and sacrifice every day have no voice.

The PAP is in control of the maze, and it does not care. Make your vote in this COVID-19 election count. Choose a Singapore where the daily struggle and sacrifice pays off for all, not just for the ‘natural aristocracy’.

For Singapore’s future, this has become an imperative. We must vote to end the super majority.

Singapore wants different.",https://www.facebook.com/LeeHsienYangSGP/videos/vb.1875092342730866/2665709727008851/
2020-06-30,Progress Singapore Party,Lee Hsien Yang,POLITICS IS FOR EVERY CITIZEN,"You may not be interested in politics, but politics is interested in you.

I grew up in a family at the centre of Singapore politics. From the time I was born in 1957, politics was a part of my family, as my father fought first for independence for our country and then led the challenging and arduous journey Singapore took to nationhood.

It would have been the most natural thing for me to have entered political office. But political leadership in Singapore needs to be much more than about one family or one man. The empirical evidence shows that dynastic politics causes bad government. When people enter politics on the back of the family name, they are often evaluated based on their parents and not their performance. This unfair advantage undermines meritocracy. How can we expect politicians to hold each other to account, if they are blood relations?

I chose instead to enter the world of business, to be accountable to shareholders, employees and customers, and the community. I also sought to contribute to Singapore through volunteering in other institutions beyond my corporate roles. I wanted to forge my own path, to be my own man and a man of my word.

I have chosen not to stand for political office because I believe Singapore does not need another Lee. I am interested in politics. I am involved through speaking up, by supporting candidates and parties I believe in, by contributing my time, ideas and resources to causes I support, and by seeking an open and independent media. I do not seek power, prestige or financial rewards of political office. I hope to be a catalyst for change.

Being involved in politics can take many different forms. Amongst others it needs citizens to be aware of and contribute to the public discourse in the country, to support political parties one believes in, and to help them reach out to other voters. It is support for an independent media and for open and transparent government. It is being engaged, speaking truth to power, volunteering one’s time and contributing financially or otherwise for causes that one believes in. Politics is both the right and the duty of every citizen.

Our country needs a broad and diverse parliament with members who care for its citizens and the future of our nation and hold themselves accountable to the citizens. It needs people from different walks of life who can imagine, inspire and execute. We need new ideas to reinvigorate Singapore. We must have genuine discussions and rigorous debate involving a diversity of Singaporean voices as we seek to navigate the challenging waters ahead. We need leaders who listen and who are receptive to those voices and needs.

In the last few years, I have been approached by countless Singaporeans who have asked me to stand for political office. These are Singaporeans from all walks of life. I am deeply humbled. Many Singaporeans are very troubled that Singapore no longer has the leadership it needs. Sadly, the current government has failed its people. The rising anger and frustrations of the populace speaks for itself. The PAP has lost its way.

We need to take action now. Speak up and be heard. Discuss openly the issues facing our country. Read and share independent journalism. Seek transparency and accountability in government. Talk to your friends and family to help them see the need for change. Volunteer your time and resources to support the parties you believe in.

Vote fearlessly. Rescue the future of the country we love.

Politics is not just for politicians. It is for every citizen.",https://www.facebook.com/LeeHsienYangSGP/posts/2669167803323312?__tn__=-R
2020-06-30,Workers' Party,Pritam Singh,Make Your Vote Count: Message for voters,"This election is taking place amidst extraordinary and difficult times — an economic downturn amidst a public health emergency, COVID-19.

But beyond COVID-19, this election is incredibly important. As voters, you get to decide the Singapore you want for the next five years and more. Your vote is crucial to decide how Singapore’s political system will function to serve you.

The Workers’ Party (WP) offers Singaporeans a choice, and an alternative voice in Parliament. We are pro-Singapore — Rational, Responsible, and Respectable.

This political creed was established many years ago by our former Secretary-General, Low Thia Khiang, who, with other party leaders, is stepping down in this election as part of WP renewal. Their retirement is not a departure. They will continue to guide our younger leaders, who embody and uphold the same values.

The new WP members have the same ‘never say die’ spirit to overcome new challenges, the same way the WP overcame many other obstacles put in its way previously; Like the challenge of AIM – the $2-PAP company – that pulled out the town council’s computer system after the WP took over the Aljunied Town Council.

Even with only six elected seats in Parliament, the WP has contributed significantly to the democratic processes in our country. Former PAP MPs who wrote their memoirs after 2015 have helped to expose the limitations of a Parliament dominated by the PAP. One former PAP Senior Minister of State remarked that the victory of the WP in GE2011 forced PAP MPs and Ministers to walk the ground more frequently.

Another PAP Senior Minister of State revealed his opposing ideas to any Group Representation Constituency (GRC) which consisted of more than 3 MPs —  so as to ensure that Singapore’s democracy works. Their reflections remind Singaporeans about the shortcomings of an imbalanced political system and the effect of elected WP MPs.

An elected opposition is necessary to keep the ruling party on its toes and to challenge the PAP for the betterment of Singapore.

Over the last Parliamentary term, WP MPs spoke up in Parliament on a wide range of issues reflecting the concerns and aspirations of Singaporeans to hold the PAP accountable. The WP questioned the basis for the reserved Presidential Election. WP MPs also questioned corrupt practices in a government-linked company when not a single PAP MP filed a parliamentary question on the matter — one of the most serious corruption revelations in Singapore’s history.

WP has also called for the Government to reveal its expenditure and revenue projections before looking to raise the GST. Voters would remember how the PAP tried to force the WP to apologise when it questioned the motive behind the early announcement of the upcoming GST hike.

This is an example of how the WP functions as an opposition party in Parliament. The WP carries your mandate into Parliament, holding the government to account. It also scrutinizes government policy to safeguard the rights and interests of all voters.

Our COVID-19 experience thus far informs all Singaporeans that the decision-making processes of the fourth-generation or 4G PAP leadership leaves more to be desired. It must be checked by a constructive opposition.

Even as Singapore grapples to defeat COVID-19, a number of national issues of long-term priority will surface for discussion and debate in the months and years to come. These will include immediate concerns like fair hiring for Singaporean workers and PMETs, regardless of age or gender. 

Then there are broader issues like inequality and social mobility, to specific issues likes fiscal sustainability and climate change. All these issues and more, will require parliamentary scrutiny, and challenge if necessary.

The Workers’ Party candidates in GE2020 look forward to strengthening this nation that we all call home, in a democratic environment all Singaporeans can be proud of.

2020-06-30,People's Action Party,Lee Hsien Loong,Letter to voters,"COVID-19 is the most severe crisis for humanity in a very long time. Every Singaporean has been affected by the pandemic. My Government has spared no effort to support workers, businesses and households. We have done our best to minimise the effects, but the crisis is far from over.

Some of you have lost jobs, and many more have seen your incomes fall significantly. We are all worried by what lies ahead. We need the most capable team in charge, and a Government which has your strong mandate. Whoever leads Singapore during this crisis must have the full support of its people to make the difficult decisions needed for recovery. I ask you to entrust this responsibility once again to the People’s Action Party.

My team and I will work with you to overcome this crisis of a generation. Our manifesto sets out our plans to get through this crisis safely, and then to recover strongly. Our first priority is to save jobs, and help you get back to work if you’ve lost your job. All who need extra help will get it — be it for housing, healthcare, education or retirement. We will continue to invest in Singapore so that your children and grandchildren can look forward to a brighter future.

I will devote all my energy to this effort, as I have done for 15 years as PM. But I cannot do this alone – I need your full support, and an able team of Ministers and MPs to help me. Now, more than ever, Singapore needs a capable Government, trusted to make the right decisions for all of us. Please vote for me and my PAP team. 

Together, we will secure our lives, our jobs, our future.",https://prodwpbolb.blob.core.windows.net/media/2020/06/letter-from-pap-sec-gen-jun2020.pdf
2020-07-01,People's Action Party,Lee Hsien Loong,Message to voters,"This General Election is critical for our future.

The government that you elect will have its hands full. It must continue fighting the virus, and keep Singaporeans safe. It must save jobs and businesses, so our people can continue to make a living. It must persevere with our long-term plans, so Singaporeans can still look forward to a better future.

All these are massive challenges.

Our lives, our jobs and our future are at stake.

For us to come through, we will need two critical elements. First, the best possible leadership for Singapore. Second, a solidly united population, that gives the leaders they have chosen full support.

Our Lives
We have been fighting COVID-19 since the beginning of this year. It has been a tough and relentless battle. There were some heart-warming stories of recovery. A centenarian, an old lady aged 102, caught the virus, recovered and is now again enjoying her favourite durian. A Bangladeshi worker, hospitalised for five months, is now discharged, and looking forward to going home and seeing his new born son for the first time. These stories have encouraged and motivated our people working tirelessly on the frontlines.

But we are still in the thick of this fight. Up to now, we have kept Singaporeans safe, through a heroic effort. The Ministerial Task Force has led our efforts to combat COVID-19. The Task Force has mobilised the whole public service, with support from many volunteers and activists. Singaporeans have played your part too, by following safe distancing rules, minimising social contact, wearing masks when outdoors, and maintaining good personal hygiene. Your cooperation has made all the difference.

We will have to sustain this collective effort for perhaps a year, or even longer. We are opening up in phases, businesses are restarting, Singaporeans are getting back to work, extended family and friends can meet again. But as we open up, we must be prepared for a resurgence in cases. It has happened in South Korea, Germany, and several states in the US, which have opened up after initially curbing the virus.

How can we prevent this from happening in Singapore? On the government’s part, we are expanding testing capacity and improving our contract tracing, to identify and stamp out new cases faster. But this is only half the solution. We must all continue to maintain discipline and comply with the safe distancing rules. 

Even if our daily cases have come down, and the problem appears to have gone away because this is the only way to keep the number of cases low, and to protect our families and others around us. Our success depends on the government and people working together and trusting each other. If we are careless or lax, a major outbreak can happen, and we may have to lock ourselves down again and that would be a severe setback.

An equally essential task for the government is to restart our economy. COVID-19 has caused a global recession, the deepest since the Great Depression. We have avoided massive job losses and company closures so far, because we acted decisively.

But the worst of the economic downturn is yet to come, especially since the virus is surging again in the US and elsewhere. There will be more retrenchments and some of these jobs may never come back.

Therefore, one key focus of the government, in the coming months and years, must be jobs. We are doing our best to encourage companies to keep their workers and take on new ones. We aim to create 100,000 new job and training opportunities and we are investing heavily in SkillsFuture, so Singaporeans can pick up new skills and move on to better jobs.

But beyond subsidies and support schemes, fundamentally we must grow our economy in order to create more new jobs in total and new investments are an important way to do that. 

EDB is working very hard to attract investments to Singapore. They secured $13bn in new investments in only the first three months of this year and this is extraordinary, because in an ordinary year we attract around $10bn only during the whole year. This $13bn of investments in the first quarter will generate several thousand jobs over the next few years

How was EDB able to do this, during a pandemic and a recession? It is because Singapore enjoys a strong reputation internationally, and investors have confidence in us. Investors know the quality of our government – they have met our Ministers and worked with our public service. They also know our government has strong popular support. They are confident that the government can get Singaporeans to back policies that will grow the economy, attract talent and investment, and eventually create jobs for Singaporeans. These have been the fundamentals of our economic success, and the reason why MNCs have kept faith with us. In a crisis, it is even more critical for us to reinforce these fundamentals, in order to attract more investments and jobs to Singapore.

Our Future
Even as we deal with the immediate priorities of fighting COVID-19 and reviving our economy, we must not lose sight of our longer-term mission to improve Singapore. 

One day, the pandemic will pass. The recession will be over but the world after COVID-19 will look very different. Our external environment will be less stable. The world economy will be less integrated. It will not just be a changed world, but a changing one. We will have to be resilient and adaptable, to earn our living in this new world.

But we cannot only be responding to changes in the world. We must know where we want to go, and how we will get there. What do we want for Singapore? How can we make it happen, despite the great changes around us? Even as we battle through the worst of the storm, we must not let the wind and the waves carry us where they will. We may have to take down some sails, divert around the worst weather, shift our present course but our ultimate destination does not change.

The PAP has many long-term plans for Singapore. Every National Day Rally, I have been sharing these plans with you, to give you a sense of where we are going, and what Singapore can be. We have ideas for more and better pre-schools, for affordable healthcare for the elderly. We want to transform Singapore’s landscape by developing new HDB towns and parks, by building new MRT lines and Changi Terminal 5, by realising the Punggol Digital District and the Greater Southern Waterfront and we have begun preparing for climate change.

These are ambitious plans, spanning decades with the crisis, we will have to revise some of them. E.g. delaying Changi T5 for two years while we reassess the aviation industry post-COVID-19 but our basic ideas remain valid, and we are resolved to realise them. Because we are determined to always be exceptional, always distinguishing ourselves in an ever-changing world. So that every generation improves on what they have inherited, and can pass on a better Singapore to their children.

Capable government leadership is essential in this endeavour. But the leadership can only succeed if it wins the strong support of the people. Our people too must feel that we are building Singapore not just for the current generation of Singaporeans, but as a sustained effort spanning generations. 

The world may be uncertain, and many dangers lurk which can derail our plans. But if our government and people are united, trusting each other and working together with a clear direction, we can overcome any challenge that comes our way, and make steady progress, decade by decade, towards our long term vision.

Leadership
In this election, Singaporeans are choosing the leadership team to take Singapore safely through the current pandemic and economic pain, and also to lead you beyond the crisis, into better days ahead.

My PAP team has worked very hard to put together the best team to serve you. It is an experienced team anchored by Ministers and MPs who have seen Singapore through past crises, and therefore know what to expect, what to do, what pitfalls and traps to avoid.

We have also refreshed the team with a younger generation of promising Singaporeans. They come from all walks of life. Indeed, our new candidates this time are among the most grounded, the most organic, the most relatable we have had in years. They have been knocked about and learnt about life, made mistakes and learnt from them. They reflect our evolving society, and they each have their individual perspectives and passions. Most importantly, they all share core values and convictions, and the courage to do right by Singapore, like every generation of PAP leaders before them.

The PAP is determined to provide Singapore not only a strong leadership team for the next five years, but a team that has depth, and continually renews itself for the future. This is why the PAP has an unremitting focus on leadership renewal. My duty as PM is not just to take good care of Singapore during my own time in office. I must also prepare younger leaders to be ready to take over the baton from me and my older colleagues

That is why I put the younger Ministers in charge of the Ministerial Task Force. They are directing our response to COVID-19. This is not a dry run, nor even a live firing exercise. This is deadly serious real-life crisis management, in an unprecedented global crisis. I am happy that over the last six months, the younger Ministers have proven that they are up to the task. This is what it means to be a responsible steward of Singapore, and of our future.

Conclusion
For 60 years, the PAP has served Singaporeans faithfully. We led the Pioneer Generation to fight for self-government and independence. We worked with the Merdeka Generation to take our country from Third World to First. Singapore has made it thus far against all odds, only because generations of Singaporeans have trusted the PAP, and worked with us to build this country. Your support has been the PAP’s greatest strength. And the PAP has never let you down.

Now, we must face the crisis of a generation together, and carve out our place in the world anew. I ask you to once again give me and my PAP team your mandate. Please vote for the PAP . So that we can work with you, for you, and secure our lives, our jobs, our future.",https://www.pap.org.sg/news/ge2020-news/message-from-secretary-general-lee-hsieng-loong/
2020-07-05,Progress Singapore Party,Lee Hsien Yang,CHARACTER AND COURAGE,"This election year, Singapore is seeing a surge of credible and capable alternative candidates. They are caring and authentic. 

Many have impressive qualities and qualifications. But what matters even more is their preparedness to speak out fearlessly for the needs of their fellow Singaporeans.

Standing for the opposition needs character and courage in a way that standing on a PAP ticket does not. It demonstrates a willingness to sacrifice for our country.

Alternative candidates have often been victims of unfair treatment, character assassination, and dissuasion from frightened family and friends. These candidates step forward to seek justice and equality for all. They have chosen to speak out because they are concerned for the future of our country.

Contrast this to the monochrome of PAP candidates. For many, entering the political arena appears like a career step. They are supported by a huge machinery, have the benefits of makeovers and the prospect of a parachute into Parliament on the coat-tails of a Minister.

Do we really want Parliament to be a mere stepping stone from a senior position in the SAF or civil service or some government-related body to higher office? Have paper qualifications and years of “grooming” created better or stronger leaders? Has the PAP system enhanced the performance of our 4G leaders? Do we want to perpetuate the PAP’s “natural aristocracy”?

PAP MPs can generally expect smooth careers, some into Cabinet and other very highly paid political positions, others with directorships and various other positions. Given party expectations and obligations, and the party whip, they rarely speak up in Parliament to question issues of importance and they predictably vote as the party directs. For them, entering politics looks like a calculated career move rather than a sacrifice or service.

Not for them the path of Dr Tan Cheng Bock, who has always been his own man, and that rare MP who exercised independence of mind. Unlike him, even moderate PAP MPs can become part of the group-think.

Opposition MPs will question unpopular policies. They will fight any attempt by the PAP to raise GST. They can question outrageous ministerial salaries and conflicts of interest at Temasek and elsewhere. They will continue to question oppressive laws that silence rights to free speech and public assembly.

Speaking their minds and tenacious questioning is how they will protect us from abuse of power and help create transparency and accountability. “Ownself check ownself” does not work.

The Workers Party MPs ferreted out how $22 billion of stimulus spending for the Covid-19 pandemic is actually loan capital. They challenged the Constitution amendments on how we elect our President. The list of issues they have spoken up on is extensive: the government’s population white paper, corruption in GLCs, HDB leases, MRT breakdowns, our CPF, spending on foreign students, the Administration of Justice Act, the Prevention of Harassment Act and POFMA.

For accountability, we need our elected representatives in Parliament to be willing to speak up and uncover the truth behind the PAP’s claims. We need them to be our voices and our vote in Parliament.

Have your voices actually heard in Parliament. Vote for the opposition.",https://www.facebook.com/LeeHsienYangSGP/posts/2672938199612939?__tn__=K-R
2020-07-06,People's Action Party,Lee Hsien Loong,Fullerton Lunch time Rally,"In almost every General Election since independence, the PAP has held a rally near Fullerton. We usually hold it after the mid-point of the campaign. It is an occasion to pause, take stock of what has happened in the hustings so far and refocus everyone’s minds on what is at stake. Unfortunately, because of COVID-19, we cannot convene a physical Fullerton rally this year. So I have to speak to you virtually online, but my purpose is the same.

A Critical Election
Hardly ever in our history have the stakes been higher than now. We are in the middle of a crisis but as tough as the past months have been, our biggest challenges lie ahead of us. Globally, the number of COVID-19 cases continues to surge. We don’t know how the pandemic will end, or whether a lasting solution will be found –be it a vaccine or more effective treatment. We face a continuing danger to public health. It will also weigh heavily on the economy, for perhaps a year if not longer.

All our experience since the beginning of this year has made clear just how important a good government is to fight COVID-19, supporting the economy, and get out of this crisis intact. This is what this election is about–whom do you trust to get you through the very difficult times ahead.

COVID-19
Our COVID-19 situation is stable. Our healthcare system has held up well. Our fatality rate is among the lowest in the world. In the migrant worker dormitories, the outbreak is being systematically cleaned up.

We have managed to get to this stage not by chance, but by dint of immense effort.

First, we have been preparing for a pandemic since SARS. We systematically built up our resources and capabilities. Stockpiling masks and PPE, training healthcare workers, practising our contact tracing and reporting. For 17 long years, we sustained these preparations. We dealt with H1N1, we prepared for Ebola and MERS. We never took our eyes off the ball. So when COVID-19 hit the region and the world, we had a good base to work off.

But every disease is different. COVID-19 is not the same as SARS. It is less lethal, but far more infectious. The post-SARS preparation was essential, but not enough. When COVID-19 hit us, we had to scramble. One challenge was to secure more face masks amidst a worldwide shortage. Another was to ramp up testing so that we could detect new cases faster and stop them spreading. Countries had banned the export of instruments and chemicals needed to run the tests.

We had to ramp up labs and are set up new ones. We had to manufacture more test kits and accurately process the results. We recruited and trained swab teams to perform the thousands of swabs needed every day. Behind the scenes, this was a highly complex operation.

For now, test capacity is no longer a constraint for us. But we are still building up reserve testing capacity, just in case. Despite our best efforts, in April, the virus broke out in our migrant worker dormitories. The large numbers posed a real risk of overwhelming our hospitals. We had to mount a huge operation. We mobilised the SAF and Home Team to help manage the dormitory situation. We even opened up SAF camps to house vulnerable workers and keep them safe. We arranged for every worker to be fed, cared for, and paid on time. We built new isolation and medical facilities. Within weeks, we created almost 30,000 bed spaces in the Changi Expo, PSA Tanjong Pagar Terminal and elsewhere – more bed spaces than all our acute hospitals put together.

All these extremely demanding tasks had to be performed in the fog of war. We had to decide and act urgently, based on incomplete information. The public service, including our healthcare workers, the SAF and Home Team, responded magnificently. They took directions from the Multi-Ministry Task Force (MTF), led by Gan Kim Yong and Lawrence Wong. At every step, we faced difficult trade-offs between lives or livelihoods. Crucial decisions had to be made. It was the Ministers who made these decisions and are accountable for them.

One major decision was whether to impose a circuit breaker. Doing it would come at a great cost to jobs and businesses but not doing it meant risking a major outbreak and loss of lives. We had to decide, one way or another, before it was obvious or much less certain that cases would shoot up. It was a big decision. Kim Yong and Lawrence brought the matter to Cabinet. The Cabinet discussed it, weighed the pros and cons, and decided to go ahead. As it turned out, we acted just in time – as the numbers were growing, but before they shot up dramatically.

The implementation of the circuit breaker was not straightforward either. How to cushion the huge impact on jobs and incomes? How to do home-based learning for students? How to get Singaporeans to observe the necessary but painful measures? I did a live TV broadcast, to explain to Singaporeans why we were imposing the circuit breaker, and to ask people to please play their part and stay home.

This was a political decision, not an administrative one. The Ministers, and ultimately the PM and Cabinet, have responsibility. Without a team of capable Ministers, working closely together on all these different aspects We would not have been able to implement the anti-COVID-19 measures. We would have lost the confidence of Singaporeans and you’ve seen this happen many times elsewhere. Political leaders fail to act competently. Voters lose trust in them. They are confused and dismayed. Their faith in the whole system is shaken. People suffer greatly, and many die unnecessarily.

Singapore has avoided this. We are in a better position now but even as we reopen after the circuit breaker, we cannot afford to take chances. The danger is still very much alive. In many countries, after lockdowns were relaxed, cases have flared up again. And if there is a second global wave of the pandemic, we may be hit hard again, despite all our efforts. Keeping COVID-19 under control and our people safe, avoiding another lockdown, will take everything that we’ve got. We will have to take many more difficult decisions and find more creative, radical solutions to take care of our people.

At this moment of danger and alarm, the Opposition parties are talking as if we can just keep to our old ways, and the crisis did not exist. They show no recognition that we are facing the crisis of a generation. They have been completely silent on how to tackle COVID-19 – both during the last six months, and in this election campaign. What contribution will they make in Parliament, adding “contrast” to the discussions they say, if they get elected as MPs? What will happen to Singapore, if they form the government?

Our Economy
Our second major challenge is the economy. We have never been hit so hard before. In a usual year, we have one Budget. This year, we’ve had four, injecting a total of $100bn, almost far above our normal spending and that gives you a sense of COVID-19’s huge impact on businesses, and especially on workers and jobs, that we have had to counter. But it is not just about indiscriminately writing checks. We need to understand who is hurting, who needs help mostest, how to help them, what works and what doesn’t.

In the past months, we have done this systematically. The Jobs Support Scheme is a major initiative. It costs the Government more than $20 bn but it saves employers a large part of workers’ wages, and in that way keeps workers in their jobs. At the same time, we are giving extra support to households, and to those who have been more affected, like the self-employed. We also passed emergency legislation for rental and contract waivers. This was an unprecedented move.

But if we hadn’t done this contractors who missed project deadlines because of the circuit breaker would have had to pay liquidated damages. Tenants who could not do business would still have had to pay rent. Couples who could not hold weddings would have forfeited their deposits for their wedding banquets. Many individuals and SMEs would have been hurt, and many good companies would have gone under.

We were very fortunate to have a capable team to pull this off. Minister Shanmugam and SMS Edwin Tong are both Senior Counsels. They were helped by AG Lucien Wong, who is an outstanding corporate lawyer and experts from business and law, including lawyers in private practice and officers in the public service. Working frantically, they managed to put this Bill together in nine days. Parliament then passed it on a certificate of urgency – all three readings in one day. We did it again with a second set of emergency measures two months later. This is the difference that highly competent government can make to your lives.

But all these budgetary and legislative measures are emergency relief, and they cannot be sustained indefinitely. The more fundamental solution for jobs is to turn around our economy. We need to create new jobs. To do that, we must attract new investments and that means maintaining confidence in Singapore, so that companies will not lose faith in us in a crisis.

Way back in 1985, we were in a similar situation. That year, we experienced a sudden recession. Annual GDP growth turned negative for the first time since independence. I had just entered politics. Dr Tony Tan tasked me to chair the Economic Committee, to study how we could lift ourselves out of the recession and reposition our economy for the future. We took decisive, emergency measures, including cutting CPF contributions.

The younger Ministers, including me, held many meetings with union leaders and workers to persuade them. We did not just make one speech, or hold one press conference, and expect people to simply swallow the bitter pill. At the National Day Rally that year, Mr Lee Kuan Yew explained to Singaporeans, using charts and tables, why the recession had happened, how Singapore had lost competitiveness, and what we had to do to get out of the recession. People said that Mr Lee sounded like a professor giving Singaporeans an economics lecture but Singaporeans understood the message and supported the tough measures. The measures worked, and within a year our economy was growing again. That is what political leadership is about.

Once the situation stabilised, we went on the offensive. I went with EDB on a marketing pitch all over the world, to reassure investors and bring in more investments for Singapore. We placed a full-page advertisement in the Wall Street Journal, with an eye-catching headline, “Who would be mad enough to invest in Singapore in a recession?” Nowadays people might call this “clickbait”. The advertisement carried signatures of nine global heads of MNCs, including Apple, Seagate, and Motorola, and several of these companies are still here today, 35 years later.

Why were these MNCs prepared to invest in Singapore during such an economic crisis, and to sign on with Singapore? First, they knew Singaporeans were industrious and capable workers – the best workforce in the world. Second, they had experienced our tripartite relationship. Our unions were like no other unions they had encountered anywhere else in the world. Our unions and the NTUC cooperate closely with employers and government to generate growth and jobs for workers. They are not opponents to be countered, but partners in progress.

Third, the investors had high regard for our public service. EDB was a one stop shop where they could settle all their problems. Other countries have one stop shops too. The difference is their governments do not work as one, so their one stop shops cannot make things happen, as EDB can. Fourth, investors knew Singapore had a first-rate government. They had interacted with our Ministers. They knew our quality. One of them told one of our ministers: “After meeting you, we decided to invest in Singapore”. It was sincerely meant, and a huge compliment.

And finally, the investors knew the government enjoyed Singaporeans’ strong support. So the Ministers could take decisive steps if needed, and make the right decisions to promote growth and create jobs.

Maintaining this high reputation is a matter of survival for us. Singapore is a small country with many limitations, you know that by heart. We must show the world that we are indeed special, and can sustain our edge over other countries and cities. Then MNCs will invest in us, other countries will take us seriously, and Singapore has a place in the sun. Otherwise, we will just fade away and be forgotten, like so many city-states in history.

The world is watching this election closely. Will we show the world that Singaporeans are still one united people, strongly supporting the leaders they have chosen, and working together to overcome the crisis? Or will we reveal ourselves to be fractious and divided, withholding our full support from the government we have elected, in a crisis where swift, decisive action is vital to save jobs and lives? 

Investors will scrutinise the election results, and act on their conclusions. So will others, both friends and adversaries of Singapore. That is why in this election, the PAP seeks not just your mandate, but your strong mandate, to lead Singapore through this crisis.

Meanwhile, what does the Opposition have to say about getting us out of the downturn, or growing our economy, or creating new jobs. They prattle on about a minimum wage, or a universal basic income. These are fashionable peacetime slogans, not serious wartime plans.

How will a minimum wage help somebody who is unemployed? It will just add to employers’ cost, and pressure them to drop even more workers. How will we pay for a universal basic income? All the GST increases in the world will not be enough. Do you really want to vote for parties who in a crisis come up with nothing better than old recycled manifestos?

Leadership and Politics
Last month, the Ministers and I did a series of national broadcasts. We sketched out the challenges we were facing, and also our plans to overcome them. The PAP election manifesto also sets out our programme. Can we turn all these plans into reality? That depends, it depends on you giving a strong mandate for me and my PAP team.

I have worked hard to field the strongest possible PAP team for this election. It is an experienced team. It includes capable Ministers, whom I rely on to get things done, and to take care of Singaporeans through this crisis. And seasoned, energetic MPs, who will look after you in every constituency, speak up for you in Parliament, and make sure the PAP government is focussed on your needs and aspirations.

It is also a team refreshed and reinforced with a younger generation of promising leaders from all walks of life. They will bring new ideas and perspectives on tackling the challenges ahead. I hope younger and first-time voters will identify with them, and see them as candidates who represent their views and will advance their interests.

My duty as PM is not just to take good care of Singapore during my time in office. It is also to prepare new generations of leaders who can take over from me and my older colleagues, and lead Singapore into a different future. That is why this time the PAP is fielding 27 new candidates, a record number.

But to serve you, we first need to get elected. Your MPs and Ministers have done their best. You have seen our track record. If you think we have delivered, and made your life better, please vote for us. If you think we have not, then by all means vote us out. But do not confuse signals by voting Opposition if what you really want is a PAP MP to look after your constituency and town council, and a PAP Government to look after Singapore.

The Opposition says they are offering Singaporeans insurance just in case you need it but don’t buy insurance from someone on a promise, especially when you have reason to suspect this company cannot pay out on the insurance, and their cheques will bounce.

With the PAP, you know that when we promise anything, we will deliver. We have walked with Singapore for six decades. We first became the Government in 1959. The PAP won that crucial first election, because we represented the national consensus and our people’s collective hopes for their future.

After more than 60 years, this has not changed. The PAP still reaches out broadly to the population. Our policies have improved people’s lives beyond measure. We have maintained trust with the people and we have renewed our leadership, to keep the party vigorous and in sync with your aspirations. As ESM Goh recently put it, we believe in political renewal, not political recycling.

I cannot say that such a state of affairs will last forever but do not undermine a system that has served you well. Look at countries that change governments regularly. Their political consensus has frayed. After a government falls, what follows isn’t a new, more stable equilibrium, but more frequent changes of governments and divisive politicking. People appear to have a choice, but often the more things change, the more they remain the same. These countries have not done better than Singapore.

So I ask Singaporeans: don’t be taken in by those who say that it is important just to have more choices. Look carefully at the choices they offer you. Ask yourself if they can deliver. Don’t be taken for a ride. Your future is at stake.

My Own Political Journey
This is my seventh Fullerton Rally. My first Fullerton Rally was in 1984, when I entered politics 36 years ago, aged 32. That was a watershed election. The PAP fielded 26 new candidates, and its self-renewal took off. Today, I am the only one left from the class of 1984. But the party now has many younger cohorts of leaders, to take the country forward.

In almost every election since 1984, I have returned to speak at the Fullerton Rally. Each time, Singapore had made more progress. Over 36 years, the changes have been dramatic. Fullerton Building today is no longer the General Post Office, but a heritage building restored to more than its old splendour. The Singapore River has been cleaned up. Marina Bay has been transformed from open water and empty reclaimed land into a vibrant downtown, alive with business, recreation and arts, alive with life.

We built all this up steadily, despite several crises along the way. In 1984 at Fullerton Square, I had a bit of my speech, speaking to young voters as a young man. I looked up what I said and according to reports, I said, “It’s great to be young, youths do not have to be sane, sober and subdued. You can stand up, dance, sing, and have fun. But also do things which are worthwhile for society because the government wants a country which is caring, where citizens are cultivated and willing to help both neigbhours and fellow citizens.” I said, “Please don’t go hell-riding, but Michael Jackson’s music is ok.” And I think that message is still a good one for young people from me 36 years older.

Within months of the election, we ran into the sharp 1985 recession, and had much more serious issues to talk about than Michael Jackson. Since then, in government, I have experienced the Asian Financial Crisis (1997-1998), 9/11 terrorist attacks and the JI threat (2001), SARS (2003), and the Global Financial Crisis (2007-2009). Each was a grave challenge. Each time we worried about the worst happening to us but each time the Government led from the front, Singaporeans rallied together, and we pulled through.

What I did not expect – what no one expected – was to meet this overwhelming crisis in the last stretch of my premiership but I count myself fortunate to have been elected by you, and chosen by my fellow ministers and MPs, to lead Singapore through this critical crisis. COVID-19 is the crisis of a generation. It is more complex and more dangerous than any previous crisis we have met. Again, there can be no certainty that things will turn out well. But we must have the same unshakeable will to marshal all our energies and resources, to fight it together, prevail and emerge stronger. Our response in this crisis will determine the future of our country, and prospects for our children and grandchildren in Singapore.

You have my word: Together with my older colleagues like Teo Chee Hean and Tharman Shanmugaratnam, as well as the younger 4G ministers, I will see this through. I am determined to hand over Singapore, intact and in good working order, to the next team.

I have spent all my adult life serving my country, because I believe in Singapore. That is why I took a scholarship to serve in the SAF. That is why when ESM Goh Chok Tong asked me to enter politics, I agreed. All my life, I have felt a deep personal responsibility to do my part to keep Singapore safe, and to make it succeed.

Now, to get through this crisis, I need your help. I cannot do it alone. I need the strongest team we can find, to work with me, and with you. I also need full support from all of you. From the Pioneer and Merdeka Generations, who have done so much to build this Singapore, and want to stay healthy and well for many years to come. From parents with children, who want to live in a country where their kids have a bright future. From young men and women, starting work at a difficult moment, but with their adult lives ahead of them, and the country’s future in their hands.

If we all work together and build well, generation after generation, then another 36 years from now. The Fullerton rally will be held in a vastly transformed Singapore and future Singaporeans – today’s young ones – can be proud of what they have built.

But at this critical moment, Singapore needs a capable government, with the full support of a united people, more than ever. Have no fear. Instead, be confident. Singapore will endure this searching trial. We will be tested, but we will not be found wanting.
