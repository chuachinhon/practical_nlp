CNA,2020-03-19,Wuhan's new COVID-19 cases could cease by mid-late March: Report,"SHANGHAI: Wuhan is expected to see new coronavirus infections dry up by mid-to-late March and the lockdown of the central Chinese city, the epicentre of the outbreak, may be lifted once there are no new cases for 14 days, the state-backed China Daily reported.

However, strict disease control and prevention measures will still be needed to prevent a possible rebound, China Daily reported on Thursday, citing epidemiologist Li Lanjuan.

Li is the director of China's State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases.

""If no new case of the coronavirus has been reported for 14 consecutive days in Wuhan following the last reported case, we believe it will be the time when the lockdown can be gradually lifted,"" Li told China Daily. ""We expect new cases will cease to appear in mid or late March.""

""After the lockdown is loosened, we still need to strictly carry out routine measures to prevent and control the virus to prevent a possible rebound of the outbreak.""

Wuhan, a city of 11 million and the capital of central Hubei province, has been locked down since the Chinese New Year festival in mid-January, and remains the only city still designated as ""high-risk"" in the province and subject to strict travel bans.

The death toll from the coronavirus in Hubei stood at 3,130 as of Mar 18, accounting for more than a third of the global tally of over 8,000 deaths.

But Wuhan reported no new cases on Wednesday for the first time since the outbreak. It previously saw just one domestic transmission per day on Monday and Tuesday. The rest of Hubei has had no new infections for almost two weeks.

Overall, mainland China is seeing fewer local transmissions. It last reported 34 new confirmed cases on Wednesday, the National Health Commission said, all of which are imported infections.

CNA,2020-03-04,Researchers identify two novel coronavirus types as China cases dwindle,"SHANGHAI: Scientists in China studying the viral disease outbreak's origin said they had found that two main types of the new coronavirus could be causing infections.

The researchers, from Peking University's School of Life Sciences and the Institut Pasteur of Shanghai under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, cautioned that their analysis examined a limited range of data, and said follow-up analyses of larger data sets are needed to better understand the virus's evolution.

The preliminary study found that a more aggressive type of the new coronavirus associated with the disease outbreak in Wuhan accounted for about 70 per cent of analysed strains, while 30 per cent was linked to a less aggressive type.

The prevalence of the more aggressive virus decreased after early January 2020, they said.

""These findings strongly support an urgent need for further immediate, comprehensive studies that combine genomic data, epidemiological data, and chart records of the clinical symptoms of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),"" they wrote.

Their findings were published on Tuesday (Mar 3) in the National Science Review, the journal of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The findings come amid a fall in new coronavirus cases following crippling restrictions imposed on the world's second-largest economy to stop its spread, including transport suspensions and the extension of the Lunar New Year holiday.

Mainland China had 119 new confirmed cases of coronavirus on Tuesday, the National Health Commission said, down slightly from 125 the previous day, in a broad trend that has seen numbers of new cases fall from the middle of February.

The total number of cases on the mainland has now reached 80,270. The number of deaths rose by 38 to bring the total toll for mainland China to 2,981 by Mar 3.



All but one new death occurred in Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak.

OVERSEAS SPREAD

With the number of new daily infections overseas now exceeding new cases in China, Chinese officials have begun to seek ways to control the spread of the virus outside of China and guard against future outbreaks.

Authorities have asked overseas Chinese hoping to return home to reconsider their travel plans, while cities across the country have set up quarantine rules for those entering from high-risk places.

Italy, South Korea and Iran have all become infection hot spots.

An infected person is known to have arrived in China from Iran last week.

China is encouraging domestic producers of medical protective equipment to export protective suits to meet overseas demand as the virus spreads, Cao Xuejun, an official with China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said in a press briefing in Beijing on Wednesday.

China's health authorities are also studying setting up emergency reserves for medical resources and protective materials, Mao Qunan, an official at China's National Health Commission said at the same briefing.

The coronavirus outbreak had exposed the weakness of China's emergency reserves, he said.

CNA,2020-03-05,Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity ordered closed over COVID-19 fears,"BETHLEHEM: The Church of the Nativity was ordered closed on Thursday (Mar 5) and foreign tourists were banned from West Bank hotels after four suspected COVID-19 cases were found in the Palestinian town of Bethlehem.

The measures announced by the Palestinian Authority's tourism ministry came as a particular blow to the Biblical town, whose businesses are largely dependent on Christian visitors to the church, built on the traditional site of Jesus's birth.

Just three months ago Bethlehem was hailing its best Christmas for two decades, the mayor and hoteliers said, even better than the 1.5 million visitors it received in 2018.

The Latin Patriarchate of the Holy Land said the Church of the Nativity, which was first founded in 339 and rebuilt and extended over the centuries, would be closed for two weeks, along with other churches and mosques in the Bethlehem area.

The ban on foreign guests at West Bank hotels will also last two weeks, the tourism ministry said.

""This affects us dramatically,"" said Joey Canavati, manager of the 58-room Alexander Hotel in Bethlehem. ""Our workers are essentially laid off for the next 14 days. We will be closed down completely. It destroyed our business from every perspective.""

Canavati said groups of tourists from the United States, Poland and Cameroon had already cancelled their bookings.

Palestinian health officials said they were examining whether four workers at another hotel in Bethlehem had contracted coronavirus from tourists who had stayed there recently.

Police surrounded the hotel, as authorities awaited the results of laboratory tests. There have been no confirmed cases of the disease in the West Bank. Fifteen people have been diagnosed with the virus in neighbouring Israel.

The Palestinian governor of the West Bank town of Nablus on Thursday ordered its Muslim and Christian holy sites shut as a public health precaution.

The Palestinian Authority exercises limited self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank under interim peace accords.

On Wednesday, Israel ordered travellers arriving from Germany, France, Spain, Austria and Switzerland to go into home quarantine over coronavirus concerns and cancelled a military exercise with troops from the US European Command.

The measure effectively cut off foreign tourism from those countries, whose citizens, the Health Ministry said, would not be allowed into Israel unless they could show they had made quarantine arrangements ahead of time.

Israel has already imposed the edict with regard to flights from Italy, China and Singapore.

CNA,2020-03-19,NATAS travel fair in May cancelled as COVID-19 outbreak continues,"SINGAPORE: Amid a COVID-19 outbreak that has prompted various countries to issue travel advisories, the National Association of Travel Agents Singapore (NATAS) has cancelled a fair scheduled for May and will “decide in due course” whether to do the same for another event later this year.

The association typically organises two massive travel fairs a year - one in February or March and the second in August or September.

It had planned to hold its first travel fair for the year last month but decided to postpone it to early-May due to the outbreak of COVID-19.

In a statement on Wednesday (Mar 18), NATAS said it is now cancelling the event after carefully considering recent developments, which include travel advisories issued by Singapore and other countries, public health risk assessment and an uncertain travel sentiment.

A “vast majority” of participating vendors were in favour of cancelling the event, it said, adding that it will offer a full rental refund to those vendors.

NATAS is also reviewing the status of the travel fair scheduled in August.

“(We) will decide in due course if we should call for a postponement or cancellation of the fair,” the statement said.

The travel industry is among those hardest hit by the COVID-19 outbreak, as tourists stay away and locals cut back on overseas travel.

Authorities have urged Singaporeans to defer all travel abroad amid a heightened risk of importing COVID-19 cases into the country.

It was also announced on Wednesday that all Singaporeans, permanent residents, long-term pass holders and short-term visitors entering Singapore from 11.59pm on Friday will be issued a 14-day stay-home notice.

Singapore reported a new daily high of 47 new COVID-19 cases on Wednesday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the country to 313.

CNA,2020-03-12,China's coronavirus epicentre Hubei sees single-digit cases for first time,"BEIJING: China confirmed only eight new coronavirus infections in Hubei province, the first time the epicentre of the epidemic recorded a daily tally in single-digits, as tough containment measures dramatically slow the spread of the virus in mainland China.

The capital of Hubei, Wuhan, reported all eight new cases on Wednesday, the National Health Commission said on Thursday (Mar 12).

The domestic spread of the disease has slowed markedly in the past seven days, a result of weeks of strict measures imposed to control the movement of people and traffic, including the virtual lockdown of Wuhan, a city of 11 million people.

Outside of Hubei, mainland China had seven new cases, including six cases imported from abroad.

Of the six imported cases, Guangdong province accounted for three, while Gansu province and Henan province were responsible for two and one, respectively.



Overall, the 15 new confirmed cases in mainland China on Wednesday was a drop from 24 cases a day earlier.



That brings the total number of confirmed cases recorded in mainland China to 80,793. As of Tuesday, 62,793 people have recovered and been discharged from hospital, or nearly 80 per cent of the overall infections.

The death toll in mainland China had reached 3,169 as of the end of Wednesday, up by 11 from the previous day. Hubei accounted for 10 of the new deaths, including seven in Wuhan.

The ruling Communist Party newspaper, the People's Daily, warned in an editorial that while the number of new virus cases in China is falling, conditions were still difficult and there were risks of further outbreaks.

As the spread of the virus slows, China is focusing on restarting factories and businesses hit by strict containment policies which prevented millions of people from travelling and returning to work after extended China Lunar New Year holidays.

Factory activity plunged to its worst level on record in February, and while more businesses have reopened in recent weeks as containment measures are eased, analysts do not expect activity to return to normal levels till April.

Local governments must do their utmost to ensure people return to work as soon as possible, the official China Daily said in an editorial.

Many businesses are still facing labour shortages and supply-chain disruptions, the China Daily said.

""The epidemic control measures have put an enormous strain on China's enterprises, especially the small and medium-sized ones in the service sector,"" it said.

""Any further delay in their return to normal operations will entail widespread bankruptcies and job losses, which will threaten social stability.""
