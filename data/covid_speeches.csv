2020-06-07,Lee Hsien Loong,Overcoming the crisis of a generation,"Our fight against COVID-19 continues.

We have made good progress. In the community, new cases have come down. In the migrant worker dormitories, the situation has stabilised. Our healthcare system is coping well, thanks to the outstanding work of our healthcare professionals, and many others on the frontline. Most importantly, among both Singaporeans and migrant workers, we have kept fatalities low – one of the lowest rates in the world.

As a result, we have been able to move out of the circuit breaker. We are opening up our economy and society, progressively and safely. As we ease up, I expect the number of cases to rise somewhat, as has happened in other countries. So we are moving cautiously. We want to avoid the numbers shooting up again, and having to impose a second circuit breaker. We will step up testing and contact tracing significantly. Then we can catch new cases early, isolate them and their contacts, and stamp out clusters before they grow. If all goes well and the outbreak remains firmly under control, we will ease up further, and resume more activities as soon as possible. In the meantime, please continue to play your part: maintain personal hygiene and wash your hands frequently, wear a mask when you are out, and keep a safe distance from others and avoid crowded gatherings.

COVID-19 will remain a problem for a long time yet. It will take at least a year, probably longer, before vaccines become widely available. We will have to learn to live with COVID-19 for the long term, as we have done in the past with other dangerous infectious diseases, like tuberculosis. We also have to get used to new arrangements in our daily lives. We must all adjust the way we live, work and play, so that we can reduce the spread of the virus, and keep ourselves safe.

Economic Impact

But COVID-19 is not only a public health issue. It is also a serious economic, social and political problem. It is in fact the most dangerous crisis humanity has faced in a very long time.

Because of COVID-19, the global economy has virtually ground to a halt. Governments have spent trillions of dollars to support businesses, economies and jobs. Yet, tens of millions of jobs have been lost. Families are experiencing hardship. We are in a totally unprecedented situation.

Singapore has taken a severe hit too. Our GDP is likely to shrink between 4 and 7% this year, our worst contraction ever. To protect workers, households and companies, the Government has intervened decisively through four successive Budgets. We are injecting almost $100 billion – 20% of our GDP – the largest fiscal intervention in our history. Unlike other countries, we can draw on our reserves, and do not have to pay for our support measures by borrowing. But even for us, this level of spending is hard to sustain. More importantly, these measures cannot shield us from the tectonic shifts taking place in the global economy.

Singapore depends heavily on international trade and investments. These were already slowing down before COVID-19. Now this slowdown will happen faster, and go further.

We will not be returning to the open and connected global economy we had before, anytime soon. Movement of people will be more restricted. International travel will be much less frequent. Health checks and quarantines will become the norm. It will no longer be so easy to take quick weekend trips to Bangkok or Hong Kong on a budget flight. Industries that depend on travel, like aviation, hotels and tourism, will take a long time to get back on their feet, and may never recover fully.

Countries will also strive to become less dependent on others. Especially for essential goods and services, like food or critical medical supplies. This will have strategic implications. Countries will have less stake in each other’s well being. They will fight more over how the pie is shared, rather than work together to enlarge the pie for all. It will be a less prosperous world, and also a more troubled one.

All these developments will affect Singapore greatly. Since before the time of Raffles, we have made a living by connecting ourselves with the world. First, we were a trading hub, then an international seaport, then we made ourselves a hub for aviation, finance, and telecommunications. We have benefitted enormously from an open and connected global economy. Large parts of our economy – like manufacturing, biotech, financial services, and logistics – serve regional and world markets. Even many domestic sectors – like retail, F&B, and entertainment – rely heavily on tourism.

Now, we have to prepare for a very different future. Companies big and small will be hit hard. Some industries will be permanently changed. Many will have to reinvent themselves to survive. Workers too will feel the pain. Retrenchments and unemployment will go up. Some jobs will disappear, and will not come back. Workers will have to learn new skills to stay employed. The next few years will be a disruptive and difficult time for all of us.

We Can Be Confident

But despite these immense challenges, I say to you: Do not fear. Do not lose heart. Singapore will not falter in its onward march.

I believe we can still secure a bright future for ourselves. An even stronger and better Singapore will emerge from this crisis.

First, we have economic strengths and an international reputation built up over many decades. We are highly connected to the global flows of trade, investment, capital and people. International trade and investments may shrink, but they will not disappear entirely. Some flows will be diverted or dry up, but other new channels will open up. There will still be overseas markets, and opportunities for international partnerships. Singapore is well placed to connect ourselves to the new channels and flows, and create new businesses and jobs to replace those lost. We just have to work harder and smarter at it.

Our strong, trusted international reputation will help us greatly. In a troubled world, investors will value the assurance of a government that plays by the rules. A people who understand what is at stake and a stable political system that enables businesses to continue operating even in a crisis. The way Singapore has responded to COVID-19 – openly and transparently, neither avoiding reality, nor acting arbitrarily at the first sign of trouble – has only strengthened this advantage.

Second, we have had a head start preparing for the uncertainties ahead. For some time now, we have been working hard to transform and deepen our capabilities. Developing plans for ourFuture Economy, investing heavily to upgrade our workers through SkillsFuture, digitalising both the private and public sectors, building our innovation and R&D capabilities. All this has enabled us to stand out in Asia and the world. Nobody can predict what exactly the world will look like after COVID-19  but however things turn out, these Future Economy strategies will stand us in good stead. We need to pursue them even more vigorously now. For instance, we know that many businesses will no longer be viable. We will support these businesses to transform themselves, change their business models, or move into different and more promising fields.

More immediately, we are systematically rebooting our economy, as countries emerge from lockdowns. We are rebuilding our transport and trade links. For example, Changi has already resumed transit flights. We are working out Reciprocal Green Lane arrangements for safe travel to China and other countries. We are making our supply chains more resilient. For example, we are diversifying our sources of food. We are even buying eggs from Poland, and shrimps from Saudi Arabia.

Next, we are working hard to retain and attract talent and investments to contribute to our recovery. At a time when some countries are closing their doors, we are keeping ours open. By making the most of our head start, our workers and industries will survive the crisis better, and bounce back faster and stronger.

Third, we have programmes and plans to cope with the challenges before us. The government’s biggest priority now is jobs – helping Singaporeans to keep their jobs, or find new ones. We are particularly concerned about those in their 40s and 50s, who are often supporting children and elderly parents at the same time, and have financial commitments to meet. We are also concerned about mature workers nearing retirement, who want to work for a few more years, to build up their nest egg for old age. Lower income workers, who have not much savings to fall back on. The self-employed and freelancers, who have less job and income security in the gig economy and fresh graduates who are entering the job market in a very difficult year.

We have schemes to help all these groups. The Job Support Scheme, the Workfare Special Payment, the Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme (SIRS), the COVID-19 Support Grant and the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package. These schemes have enabled people to hold on to their jobs, and provided income support for millions of Singaporeans and their families.

We have set up a National Jobs Council, to pull together and drive all our efforts on jobs, and look at how we can create new jobs for the economy. Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam is leading this. The Council will coordinate all the Government agencies involved, and bring in NTUC and the employer groups too, to maximise the impact of our efforts. So if you need a job, there are real options to pursue, and you will have help and support.

Beyond COVID-19, and the economic challenges, we also have to deal with other important external and domestic issues. Externally, we have to navigate the changing strategic landscape. COVID-19 has worsened relations between the US and China. Actions and counter-actions are raising tensions day by day. It will become harder for countries to stay onside with both powers. It will be a more dangerous world for a small country like Singapore. We must ensure our security, and protect and advance our interests when dealing with other countries, big and small. We must also work with like-minded countries to support free trade and multilateralism, and enhance our voice and influence in the world.

Domestically, we have to strengthen our social compact. We have taken emergency measures to help everyone come through the crisis together. Beyond that, we have to think carefully how to improve our social safety nets. Sustainable social support will give people confidence to cope with the uncertainties and to make changes to their lives. At the same time, everyone must have the incentive to be self-reliant, and to progress through their own efforts. We have difficult decisions to make on priorities, resources, and budgets but the values guiding us remain the same: every Singaporean will have equal opportunities. Whatever your starting point in life, you will have access to good education, healthcare, and housing. If you fall down, we will help you to get up, stronger. You can be sure you will be taken care of. In Singapore, no one will be left to walk his journey alone.

In the next few weeks, several Ministers will address you, and share with you our plans. We have a full agenda for many years to come.

Our People are Our Strength

For our plans to succeed, for our hopes and dreams to come true, we need one final ingredient: the unity and resilience of our people. Once in a while, nations and peoples are severely tested, as we are now. Some buckle under pressure and emerge from crisis diminished. Others grow more determined as they face fearful odds, discover reserves of strength in themselves, and emerge from crisis transfigured, renewed. And that has been our Singapore story: in crises, we have never failed to wrest opportunity from danger.

Indeed, our nation was born in crisis. When we were granted independence, it was in the expectation that we would fail and come crawling back, after realising we could not survive alone. We proved otherwise. Two years later, the British suddenly announced that they were withdrawing their forces from Singapore. Again, many thought that would be the end of us. And again, we proved them wrong. The Pioneer Generation fought to master their destiny. And the Merdeka Generation put heart and soul into making Singapore succeed. Together, they weathered many storms, always looking ahead, never flinching at hard choices and challenges. And that is how we got here.

Now, at another hinge in our history, it is our turn to face the crisis of a generation. The choices that we make now will define who we are as a people, and what values and ideals we pass on to future generations. Confronting adversity, do we yield to anger, fear and bitterness? Or will we be true to ourselves, stand firm, make tough choices, and continue to trust and depend on one another?

Many Singaporeans have stepped up during this crisis. They have become more, not less, than themselves. Healthcare workers, public officers, grassroots leaders and volunteers, and many more working quietly behind the scenes. Some are taking good care of migrant workers in the dorms. Others are sewing masks, buying groceries for families under quarantine, or refurbishing computers for needy students to do Home-Based Learning. Abroad, Singaporeans have driven hundreds of kilometres to pick up fellow citizens to catch SQ flights home. These acts of solidarity and human kindness exemplify the best in us. They show how we can emerge stronger from this crisis, with a sharper consciousness of being Singaporean.

This is why I believe we can continue to be exceptional – a fair and just society, where everyone can chase their dreams. My Cabinet team, with the support of the whole public service, will do our best to lead us towards this enduring vision of what Singapore can be. We need every one of you to work with us. Together, let us take Singapore safely through this crisis, and make the Singapore spirit flourish in the world.",https://www.pmo.gov.sg/Newsroom/National-Broadcast-PM-Lee-Hsien-Loong-COVID-19
2020-06-09,Lawrence Wong,Living with COVID-19,"COVID-19 is the most serious health crisis the world has faced in a century.

We have all seen the devastating effects of the virus worldwide. When the outbreak gets out of control, the spike in cases can quickly overwhelm the healthcare system. Many people will not get the care they need, and the number of deaths will rise sharply.

We are determined to avoid the same fate in Singapore.

That’s why we’ve been going all out to control the spread of the virus, and to ensure that our healthcare system is able to care for all who are infected.

It has been a tough fight against a formidable and invisible enemy. We’ve had our share of challenges. But we faced them head-on.

Working together we’ve stabilised the situation in the migrant worker dormitories. We’ve brought down community cases significantly. We’ve protected our seniors, and kept our fatality rates low.

I thank everyone for your hard work and sacrifices in keeping our fellow citizens safe.

Most of all, I’d like to acknowledge all our officers serving on the frontline, including our healthcare professionals and volunteers. I’m speaking today at the NCID, the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, which has been at the forefront of this battle.

You have all been working flat out, making sacrifices and exceeding the call of duty. So to all of you, I want to say a big Thank You.

The strict measures and restrictions we’ve imposed over the recent months have been effective.

But they come at a high price. We’re cushioning the impact on our businesses and workers with four Budget packages this year.

But we cannot remain closed indefinitely as we have to prioritise both lives and livelihoods.

That’s why we’ve embarked on a phased approach to re-open safely. But please understand: we are not going back to life before the circuit breaker.

The vast majority of our population have not been exposed to the virus and are still vulnerable to the disease. We want to continue to provide maximum protection for our seniors and those with medical conditions. Hence we have been very cautious in our re-opening.

We are now in Phase 1 and we will continue to monitor the situation over the coming week. If the conditions remain stable, we will be able to move into Phase 2 before the end of the month.

We will then resume a broader range of activities, covering nearly the whole economy, and allow social interactions and family visits in small groups of not more than 5 people.

Externally, we are carefully easing travel restrictions and re-opening our borders, by creating “green lanes” with selected countries. These arrangements will be limited to essential travel for work reasons, and tight controls will be put in place.

When conditions permit, we will extend “green lanes” to more countries, and to non-business travellers. But it will take a while before we see international air travel recovering in a significant way, or before we can open up for mass market travel.

As we resume more activities, there will be more human contact and more opportunities for the virus to spread. So we must be mentally prepared to see more new cases.

This has happened in many other places which exited from their lockdowns, and we must expect it to happen here too.

The key is whether we are able to keep community infection rates stable. If so, we can continue on the path of progressive easing. But if the number of cases rise sharply, we will have to slow down the opening up, and even tighten certain restrictions.

Our ability to control the infection during this process of re-opening is therefore critical. And that’s why we’ve made use of the two months of circuit breaker to do two things.

First, we’ve increased our capacity and speed of contact tracing by developing new systems. We have expanded our contact tracing teams, which now include personnel from the Police and the SAF.

We are also using technology to speed up contact tracing. We have implemented the SafeEntry digital check-in/check-out system, and the TraceTogether app on smart phones. With these enhancements, we can now identify close contacts faster, isolate them, and prevent large clusters from forming.

Beyond TraceTogether and SafeEntry, we are currently developing wearable Bluetooth devices. These will work on their own without the need for a phone. You can conveniently wear or carry them around, as you go about your daily activities.

I seek everyone’s understanding and co-operation. Please use these important tools – they will help us slow down the spread of the virus and save lives.

Second, we’ve expanded our testing capacity hugely. We are procuring more test-kits, building more laboratory capacity, and recruiting and training more laboratory technicians as well as personnel to carry out swabs and take blood samples.

In early April, we were doing about 2,000 tests a day. Now, we are able to conduct about 13,000 tests a day, and we are on track to reach 40,000 tests a day in the coming months.

This expanded testing capacity is critical. It means that we can test higher-risk groups more extensively. We can also do more surveillance testing in the community, including those with respiratory symptoms. This will give us a faster and more accurate sense of the number of cases circulating undetected.

Besides the standard testing methods, we are deploying other means of detection.

For example, we are extracting waste water from manholes to test for viral fragments. This provides an additional indicator to tell us if a specific group, such as those living in a dormitory, has infected people amongst them.

We are also using serology tests – these help to identify those who were previously infected but may have since recovered, and have developed antibodies in response that can help them fight the virus.

Aggressive testing and contact tracing will improve our ability to control the spread of the virus. They will help greatly in allowing business and life to resume progressively.

In the longer-term, an important part of the solution is a vaccine.

The good news is that there is a massive global effort to develop a vaccine. And Singapore is working on this too.

We have a pharmaceutical industry, and research capabilities in biomedical science. EDB is also discussing with pharmaceutical companies to manufacture vaccines in Singapore.

If and when a vaccine becomes available, we will make sure that every Singaporean who needs it gets it, and at an affordable price.

In parallel, clinicians and researchers around the world, including teams from Singapore, are working hard to develop drugs and other therapies to reduce the severity of the disease.

But drug and vaccine development is very challenging work. There is no guarantee that the drugs currently undergoing clinical trials will be effective. And despite the intensive international efforts, it will take a long time for any vaccine to be ready and available for mass distribution.

So we have to be realistic and gird ourselves for more challenging times. It is not likely that the virus will go away. Our population will be vulnerable for a long time, in a world where COVID-19 is all around us.

We must therefore adapt to COVID-19, and learn to live with it over the long-term. This does not depend upon Government actions alone. Every one of us – government, businesses and individuals – must do our part.

What’s critical is people’s behaviour and mindsets. We must stay disciplined and vigilant, and not let our guard down. We must practise social responsibility in upholding good personal hygiene and safe distancing measures – wash our hands regularly, wear a mask wherever we go, avoid big gatherings and crowded places, and see a doctor immediately when we are sick.

We’ve been emphasising all this for some time. But it bears repeating, because individually, these are steps everyone can take to protect ourselves and our loved ones.

And collectively, these actions will make all the difference in keeping COVID-19 at bay. They will enable us to have a safe and sustainable re-opening, as we have seen in countries like Denmark and New Zealand. Conversely, if we are lax in our personal precautions, new cases and new clusters will multiply quickly, and despite our best efforts to test and trace, we might end up in another circuit breaker down the road.

So please cooperate with the restrictions, and keep everyone safe.

We also have to change the way we live and work.

COVID-19 has precipitated a shift towards more flexible work arrangements. Working from home, staggered work hours, and split team arrangements are becoming more of the norm.

Our urban plans will need to cater to these new demands. Office and building designs will also have to change, given what we now know about the risks of transmission in enclosed spaces.

We will need to improve ventilation and air filtering inside buildings. Other features like contactless fittings, automatic doors, as well as hand sanitiser and temperature monitoring stations should also become part of the norm.

Companies will have to find new and safer ways to deliver their products and services. Many are already embracing digital solutions. Some will need to change their business practices to adapt to the new environment. And I am happy that wet market stallholders and hawkers are now using digital payments more, and online platforms to reach new customers.

One major impact is on our construction sector. Construction has been a key vulnerability in this pandemic. The industry will need to institute new safeguards at worksites, and continue its push for automation and productivity, in order to reduce its reliance on migrant workers.

Workers in construction – local and foreign – will have to be tested regularly and comprehensively. We will also need to review and improve living arrangements for migrant workers.

The present dormitories are in fact the outcome of improvements made over the past decade. But despite this, and the precautions we took, we still had major outbreaks in the dormitories.

We will tighten the safeguards and build new dormitories designed to be more resilient against infection risks. But we have to be mindful that the risks will always be there, because of the large number of workers living together and sharing communal facilities. In fact, all communal living spaces, be they dormitories, nursing homes or cruise ships, will always be at risk in the event of an infectious disease outbreak.

These are significant changes, which will mean extra costs for the construction industry.

For now, the Government is bearing these costs through the Fortitude Budget. Beyond that, we will introduce other measures to cushion the impact, and to move the industry to new productivity levels.

I have no doubt that this will be a very difficult transition. But I assure everyone in the industry that we will work closely with you to get through this difficult patch, and to emerge stronger from this experience. 

Ultimately, re-opening our economy and society does not mean going back to the status quo ante. I know many are looking forward to resume your favourite activities or to get back to your usual routines. But this is not the time for big celebrations or parties. We will all need to adjust our expectations, lifestyles and norms.

We have shown our grit, adaptability and resilience during the circuit breaker, and we must continue to demonstrate the same ingenuity and resourcefulness in this new phase.

For example, we have found new and creative ways to stay in touch with family and friends – chatting and exercising online, and even having virtual meals or drinks together.

We may not be able to travel or have large gatherings anytime soon. But we are going on virtual tours, enjoying online concerts, and learning new skills through online classes. And many of us continue to draw strength from our faiths, thanks to churches, mosques and temples live-streaming their sermons and services to their followers.

In these difficult times, we have not despaired. We have not given up. Instead, adversity has brought out the best in us – both individually and collectively. We have found strength and confidence in one another. We have shown that we are capable of rising above ourselves and caring for others.

Every day, we see countless examples of Singaporeans from all walks of life going out of their comfort zones and going the extra mile – they are volunteering at the dormitories, distributing food to the elderly, and looking out for the vulnerable amongst us.

Businesses too have been leaning forward to help – they are donating masks and supplies to those in need; and contributing to our frontline COVID-19 operations.

This is the Singapore spirit that gives us the confidence to press ahead, no matter how tough the odds. The road ahead is unpredictable, and countries everywhere are continuing to search for answers and solutions. There is no guaranteed formula for success.

But it is our grit and resilience, our compassion and kindness, our cohesion and strength that will see us through this crisis of our generation.

So let us continue to stand together, unshaken in spirit and resolve. Whatever the challenges ahead, let us face them together. As one united people, we will defeat COVID-19 and we will prevail.",https://www.gov.sg/article/minister-lawrence-wong-living-with-covid-19
2020-06-11,Teo Chee Hean,Resilience in a changing external environment,"It was only 5 months ago when news of the COVID-19 virus first emerged. What began as a localised public health emergency has since become a global crisis.

The pandemic has disrupted the international system and brought about far-reaching changes that will reverberate for a long time, affecting our daily lives and our livelihoods. For example, we will not be able to travel abroad as easily as we used to for business or leisure. New standards for public health and personal hygiene are here to stay.

In many instances, the changes have sped up trends that were already there. For example, many more companies and workers have moved online, irreversibly changing the way we do business, work, or shop. This will impact the way companies compete and countries trade with each other. Working from home also means people can do the same job, not just from home here, but even from home in some other country. This can open up more working opportunities, but also intensify competition for everyone.

COVID-19 has also accelerated pre-existing geo-political trends. The US-China rivalry has intensified. Global supply chains have been up-ended. In quite a few countries, social divisions have grown starker, fracturing social and political stability. This has in turn fuelled a wave of nativism and protectionism. Countries are acting unilaterally to protect their own short-term interests. As a result, international organisations like the WHO are handicapped as they seek a coordinated global response.

These developments are threatening the international system and global order, which for more than seventy years, has provided opportunities for all countries to grow peacefully. Generations of Singaporeans have grown up believing that globalisation and open markets are part of the natural order of things. We can no longer assume that this is so.

Today, I will talk about the challenges Singapore will face, and how we intend to uphold our political and economic standing in this world. I will also outline how the Government will build greater resilience as we prepare for this new, more uncertain world, and take care of all Singaporeans.

Shaping Our Future World
How countries respond to the pandemic will shape the post-COVID-19 world. What will happen to our system of international cooperation? With intensified strategic competition, can the leading powers still cooperate sufficiently to overcome global challenges? Will the world slide back to protectionism? Will it become a technologically and economically bifurcated world?

A bleak outcome is not inevitable. What each country does, together with like-minded partners, can make a difference.

The COVID-19 crisis will affect all of us. It should motivate all countries to come together to build a more cooperative world, rather than become a reason to divide us. Pursuing narrow self-interest can leave all of us worse off, while enlightened self-interest means working together for a better outcome for everyone.

There is so much to do. Caring for the sick, protecting frontline workers, discovering effective treatments and vaccines, ensuring that there is enough for all.

And after the pandemic subsides, it will be a long road to economic recovery. We need new international protocols to gradually and safely resume cross-border exchanges. Beyond that, we need to update, reform and strengthen the global trading system to reflect the new realities. Integration and trade are always far better than isolation and conflict.

We hope that the major powers will exercise leadership to help the world overcome COVID-19. This will set the tone and lay the foundation, beyond COVID-19, for a renewed open, united and inclusive world. Then humanity can address important shared challenges that require collective global action, such as violent extremism, nuclear proliferation, cyber security, future pandemics and climate change. No single country – big or small – can solve these problems on its own.

In this changed world, some things will remain unchanged. Singapore will always be a small, multi-racial country surrounded by bigger neighbours, located between the Indian and Pacific Oceans, exposed to external forces beyond our control.

Singapore wants to be a good partner and contribute to a harmonious region. We will continue to actively promote close ties and good cooperation with our ASEAN partners, especially Indonesia and Malaysia, not least to tackle COVID-19 together.

We are working closely with Malaysia during this outbreak on the cross-border flow of people and goods. As a gesture of solidarity, we donated masks, test kits, and ventilators to Malaysia, Indonesia and other ASEAN countries. We are also working closely with ASEAN and other key partners to curb the transmission of the virus, and to limit the economic fallout on our region.

At the same time, we must deal constructively with the bilateral issues that inevitably arise between close neighbours. We will try our best to resolve these issues and achieve a win-win outcome while protecting Singapore’s interests. And until we can resolve them, we must manage and contain the bilateral problems, so that we can work on wider areas of cooperation for mutual benefit.

We also reach beyond our region to make ourselves useful to the world, even during this pandemic. We are working with key partners to keep supply chains open, connected and resilient. At the WTO, we participate actively to promote trade by updating the rules to suit the digital economy. In a world where creating, protecting and using knowledge is increasingly important, a Singaporean – Mr Daren Tang – was recently elected to be the next Director General of the World Intellectual Property Organisation. This is the first time that a Singaporean will be leading a UN agency.

As a small island state, we continue to contribute to global action to tackle climate change. In March, we submitted our updated Nationally Determined Contribution and our Long-Term Low-Emissions Development Strategy to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.

These are all key issues that will determine the shape of the world to come.

While we call on the major powers to exercise leadership to strengthen international cooperation, small countries also do have a voice and the agency to act. Thus, while the world’s largest economies have the G20, smaller- and medium-sized UN member states, including Singapore, have come together to form the 3G or Global Governance Group. This 30-member grouping provides inputs to the G20, making global discourse more diverse and inclusive. Singapore also founded and continues to lead the Forum of Small States at the UN to give its members a stronger collective voice.

The 11-member Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (or CPTPP) had its origins in the P4 agreement between Brunei, Chile, New Zealand and Singapore. The ASEAN countries are at the core of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (or RCEP), which brings ASEAN and its FTA partners together. These are examples where smaller countries have been able to seed ideas, act and draw in larger countries to foster wider cooperation. We will continue to play an active role in this arena.

To play such a constructive role on the world stage and to protect our national interests, we require an able and agile foreign service. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, together with other government agencies, work hard to help Singapore chart our path in the world and create more opportunities and space for Singaporeans. This has now become even more important with the global changes brought about by COVID-19.

A More Resilient Singapore
Singapore can hold its own in the world, only if we are strong, successful and united at home. Only then can our diplomats speak with a credible voice. Only then can we prevent adversaries from manipulating opinions and inciting discord within Singapore. Only then can we offer something of value so that others want to work with us. We can face the world outside with confidence only if we are strong inside.

The COVID-19 crisis has been a stringent test of our ability and resolve to tackle challenges at home. Dealing with it has required an unprecedented Whole-of-Nation response. We established the Multi-Ministry Task Force in January to coordinate this. The MTF has had to make difficult decisions amidst uncertainty and incomplete information, as the world struggled to understand this new, silent, fast-moving and virulent threat.

The crisis has stretched our resources and capacity. But we have been able to orientate, adapt and act rapidly as the virus came upon us in waves. Each wave required us to develop and deploy novel measures to slow down the spread, and contain it.

With patience and perseverance, and support and cooperation from everyone, we have brought down the number of cases in our general community. We have also stabilised the outbreak among our migrant workers. We are now carrying out a deliberate plan to test and clear every migrant worker living in the dormitories, so that they are well and can safely resume work. As a result, we can now begin to restart activities gradually and safely, taking all the needed precautions that Minister Lawrence Wong described in the previous broadcast.

As we emerge from the pandemic, we will need to build a more resilient Singapore, which can respond quickly and effectively in a more uncertain world. Let me touch on three aspects of our resilience: crisis response, economic resilience, and social resilience.

Crisis Response
First, COVID-19 has highlighted the importance of building reserves and resilience to respond to unexpected crises. We need not just financial reserves. We also need able and experienced people, organisational capacity and operational agility.

When COVID-19 struck, we could draw on the knowledge, expertise and capacity in our healthcare system built up after our SARS experience. And we could tap the SAF to rapidly build up our contact tracing capacity, as we did during SARS.

But no two crises are the same, and tackling COVID-19, especially the outbreak in our migrant worker community, has been a major challenge. We had heightened surveillance and tightened precautions in our migrant worker dormitories early on. Unfortunately, these turned out to be insufficient because the virus was far more infectious than SARS. On 25 March, we recorded zero cases in our dormitories. Just 10 days later, on 4 April, when the number increased to 26 cases, we acted decisively to isolate the dormitories. However, the infectiousness of this virus and the communal living conditions in the dormitories meant that in a fortnight, by 20 April, we were recording more than 1,000 new cases per day in the dormitories.

We had already anticipated the need for community care facilities and had started to build them. We accelerated these plans and scaled them up, adding new capacity daily over the first few weeks of April. At the peak, on 12 May, we were caring for close to 20,000 patients in our community care and similar facilities. This is more than the total number of beds in all our public acute hospitals. We mobilised resources from across our public service, Government-Linked Companies, and the private sector to set up and run all these facilities. Healthcare volunteers stepped forward to help man them. This is how we are able to take care of every patient without overwhelming our healthcare system and putting lives at risk.

This has been a tremendous effort. The operations are still ongoing, to bring the dormitory situation fully under control. But the number of daily cases has already come down to between a third and half of the peak. About two thirds of the patients have already fully recovered.

COVID-19 was not a mission that our SAF and Home Team had specifically prepared and trained for. But they demonstrated their readiness and flexibility by stepping up to establish the Joint Task Forces within days, to support their MOM and MOH colleagues who were already on the frontlines. The JTFs played a critical role by establishing a command, control and information system; deploying Forward Assurance and Support Teams to all the dormitories to look after more than 300,000 workers; and supporting MOH’s overall Medical Support Plan.

Every day, as many as 1,000 patients have flowed into and through our care facilities. Every one of them needed to be individually tracked, tested, monitored, isolated while infectious, moved safely to the right places, and given the right treatment.

Over the past two months, I worked closely with many of our officers and tracked closely the work they are doing. I would like to thank every one of them for their extraordinary and selfless contributions. It is a massive task, and our officers, from our entire whole-of-nation team, are doing a tremendous job.

The clear lesson for me is that in “peace-time”, we need to plan on facing the unknown, and build deep reserves of people and capabilities, so that when we face a crisis, we can act decisively, and respond flexibly and rapidly.

Economic Resilience
Second, we need economic resilience. In the immediate term, this means dealing with the direct impact of COVID-19 on our livelihoods and supply chains. Thus far, we have managed to maintain our food and essential supplies through stockpiling, diversification and self-production. These would not have been possible without the industrial capacity and economic resilience that we have built up over the years.

Keeping Singaporeans informed daily, and dealing with the crisis in a transparent, systematic and thorough way, has further strengthened Singapore’s reputation for trust, credibility and transparency in the eyes of international investors. This will stand us in good stead.

We have faced and overcome such challenges before. In 1967, during the early years of our independence, the British announced the withdrawal of their troops from Singapore. Overnight, we stood to lose 20% of our GDP and 70,000 jobs, out of a citizen population that was only half of today’s. This was a permanent, structural loss, not a cyclical downturn. But Singaporeans gritted our teeth, rolled up our sleeves, and moved ahead. We invested in education and infrastructure; opened ourselves to the world; and promoted new industries like shipbuilding and repair, electronics and tourism. We are far more resilient today than in 1967, and better positioned to create new markets, businesses and jobs to replace the ones that will be lost.

My colleagues will be elaborating on our economic resilience, recovery and growth programmes in the coming days.

Social Resilience
Every crisis strains our social fabric. The trauma of independence etched deeply in the minds of Singaporeans the need for harmony, unity and solidarity.

It begins with our children. Education for all gives every Singaporean the opportunity to build a better life, and share the fruits of our progress.

High quality, affordable public housing provides all Singaporeans a home and a stake in the country’s future. Ethnically integrated HDB neighbourhoods foster racial and religious harmony.

We have drawn on these deep reserves in times of crisis. For example, after the September 11 attacks in 2001, we faced the terrorism threat together and did not allow tensions and suspicions to divide our society. Similarly, we supported one another and came through the Asian Financial Crisis, SARS, and the Global Financial Crisis together.

COVID-19 is an even bigger test. I am heartened to see many acts of kindness, care and compassion from Singaporeans and our friends living here. They acknowledged and helped take care of our migrant workers, and they helped look after those who are more vulnerable among us, regardless of race or religion.

We all share a common humanity. What we do in a crisis reflects who we are, and the values which motivate us as a people and as a nation.

Conclusion
COVID-19 is not the first crisis we have faced, nor will it be the last. As a small country, we are more exposed and vulnerable than others. In our short history, we have repeatedly faced and overcome crises – about once every decade, some more serious than others. This COVID-19 pandemic is the largest and most complex I have encountered in more than 40 years of public service.

We have responded to COVID-19 as one nation – mobilising our financial reserves, our public services, our crisis response capacity, and our social capital. Singaporeans have stepped forward to do our part, helping others in need, keeping ourselves and others safe during the circuit breaker. We have avoided the fissures that have divided some other countries, fissures that have hindered their ability to respond properly, and cost them lives and livelihoods.

The Multi-Ministry Task Force is overseeing our national response to COVID-19. A new generation of Ministers, civil servants, healthcare professionals, Home Team and SAF officers are taking the lead. For many, this is their first major crisis. The Ministers have sought advice and tapped the experience and knowledge of their older cabinet colleagues, and consulted widely within and outside the government. Over the past few months, I have worked very closely with them. We speak daily and exchange views freely. They have stepped up to the task, worked together as a team, and led from the front. This is the way that we collectively ensure resilience and continuity in our leadership team for Singapore. 

What we have built as a nation – our solidarity, our resolve and our resilience – gives me confidence that we will overcome the current crisis and any future challenges, to build a stronger and better Singapore together.",https://www.gov.sg/article/senior-minister-teo-chee-hean-resilience-in-a-changing-external-environment
2020-06-14,Chan Chun Sing,Making a living in a COVID-19 world,"Fellow Singaporeans, COVID-19 has impacted our lives, livelihoods and lifelines, and it has aggravated already difficult global challenges. Trade and investments have come down. People and businesses in many countries have lost confidence in globalisation and technology. They have been disrupted, and their Governments have been unable to help them adjust. Bigger countries have been fighting over the tax revenues of global companies, and that has affected international competition for investments and jobs.

Countries are all doing their best to keep people safe and healthy, secure essential items, such as food and medicine, save jobs and businesses in the face of severe decline in demand and investments.

Singapore is not immune. Many Singaporeans have already lost their jobs. More job losses are expected in the coming months. Others have seen their incomes fall. It will be a tough job market in the coming years. Some businesses have closed. Many more are struggling. Most wonder how to survive, never mind thrive.

We cannot save every job and every business, but we will take care of every Singaporean. We will not let widespread unemployment erode the confidence and dignity of our people. We will grow new businesses and create good jobs for all Singaporeans.

This Government has committed almost a hundred billion dollars to care for every Singaporean, help save businesses and jobs. But it is not just about spending money. What is even more important is our ability to plan, adapt and execute. This is how we will do it.

Immediate Priorities
Our immediate focus is jobs. We will create one hundred thousand jobs and training opportunities in the coming year. The range of jobs will include healthcare, early childhood education, transport, ICT and financial services. 100,000 jobs – that is three times our usual annual number. This is how many we will need, to help those coming out from schools, as well as those retrenched. We may well need to create more jobs, if the situation worsens.

We will also increase the capacity of our training institutions to equip more workers, especially mid-career ones, with new skills required for the new economy. This help will come to where you are. We will set up job centres in every town to match displaced workers to new jobs. We will work hard to make sure everyone who wants a job can get a job.

Many say the best way to save jobs is to resume our economic activities more quickly. I understand. But opening up hastily and closing businesses again if infections spike once more, will be more disruptive to businesses and workers. Hence, let us resume safely, progressively and sustainably.

Even after reopening, we should not expect ‘business-as-usual’. Some businesses will need to change their business models. We will help you to redesign your operations and serve new markets. Many F&B businesses like SaladStop and Beauty in the Pot have launched delivery-friendly menus to serve new customers. Others still have viable business models. We will help you to rebound when demand picks up. We will support you to hire and train graduates and mid-career workers in advance. Logistics and professional services are examples of sectors where we are starting to do this.

Longer Term Goals
As we tackle the immediate challenges, we must also prepare for the future. The Future Economy Council, chaired by DPM Heng, has been driving this for the last few years.

We will invest to develop our intangible strengths – what distinguishes us; our infrastructure – for they are key enablers; and above all, our people and businesses.

Intangible Strengths
First, our intangible strengths. Over the years, many investors have chosen to site and expand their businesses here, in Singapore. They did not make this decision for the short-term, nor did they choose Singapore because we have abundant natural resources, or because we are cheaper. They chose us because of our strengths, which are not easy to replicate elsewhere. We are open, and connected with the world, we are trusted, we are united and stable as a society, and we have a skilled workforce.

For many countries, COVID-19 has accelerated the retreat from globalisation, and the erection of more protectionist barriers.

We must resist these pressures. A less connected world means a poorer world and fewer opportunities for all. A less connected Singapore means fewer and poorer quality jobs for us.

Even in a more protectionist, less connected world, we can still make a living and more. We can build capabilities to play critical roles in global supply chains to produce high quality products and services that others value. For example, we make four out of the world’s top ten drugs, we are the world’s seventh largest exporter of chemicals.

Our resilience comes from building networks, and diversifying our supply sources and markets. We will never be able to have everything we would possibly need, for the next crisis. Indeed, when lockdowns started across the world three months ago, many of our supply chains were disrupted, if not broken. Credit goes to the ingenuity and tenacity of our people for keeping us going. Our public and private sectors swung into action, reached out to their networks, opened new supply lines to bring back essentials like masks, PPE and test reagents from across the world.

Individuals from PSA, SIA, SATS, ST Logistics, NTUC, Sheng Siong and many more. Without all these unsung heroes, we would not have been able to live our lives as normally as we did in the last few months. Thank you all!

Another intangible strength is trust. Singapore is trusted globally. Throughout this crisis, we have also continued to show the world they can trust Singapore. We did not impose export restrictions or nationalise foreign investments. We kept our production lines open for global supply chains, including critical materials for surgical masks. We worked with companies to increase their production, so that we could meet Singapore’s and the world’s needs, and we facilitated the continued flow of essential goods and people through our ports and airports.

In uncertain times, our trusted brand counts for even more. Businesses have noticed. When they make their next investments to diversify their global production bases, we will be in the running. Just as how we did not restrict exports during the 1970s oil crises – that enhanced our credibility later to establish Jurong Island as a global petrochemical hub.

Our investors have stood by us through this difficult period. We know the challenges investors face, with manpower flows and family reunions. We will work closely with you to overcome the challenges together. We will keep faith with you, as you have with us.

We will work to stay connected with the world, even as the world threatens to fragment and regress towards protectionism. Despite our size, we can show the way, if we have good ideas. When promoting free trade, our initial partnerships with Brunei, Chile, and New Zealand eventually grew to become today’s CPTPP.

Together with New Zealand, we issued a Joint Ministerial Statement to resist export restrictions and uphold global supply chains. From a party of two, we now have eleven subscriber countries, and counting.

We are building a network of Digital Economy partnerships. The partnerships will define the rules for competing and cooperating in the new economy. They will create opportunities for our companies to grow their overseas markets. We have concluded such agreements with Australia, Chile and New Zealand. More are on the way.

Barring unforeseen circumstances, we look forward to signing the RCEP agreement this year. This will cover all 10 ASEAN member states, plus Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea. It will lower the cost of imports for our consumers, and exports for our producers.

These agreements and other FTAs open up new opportunities for our businesses, and will make us a more attractive base for investments to serve the region. This will signal to the world our confidence and determination to press on with regional economic integration.

Together with our trade association partners, we will translate these trade agreements into tangible advantages for our companies, through platforms like GlobalConnect@SBF.

Infrastructure
Second, as we develop our intangible strengths, we will invest in the next generation of infrastructure for Singapore.

While others have to tighten their belts, our past prudence gives us the means to continue investing in our future. This way we will gift the next generation a higher starting base, just as our predecessors did for us.

We will press on to build our connectivity infrastructure to reinforce our position as a choice hub for business, finance, trade and data flows. This is why I am here today at our port, which is the heart of our trade connections to the world.

Our long-term plans remain sound. They include projects like Changi T5, Tuas Mega Port, and submarine cable hubs. Likewise, regional developments like Punggol Digital District, Jurong Lake District, Sungei Kadut Eco-District, Greater Southern Waterfront. We will pace the timelines for these projects according to demand. But do not doubt this: We will get them all done. Together, they will create a vibrant and innovative Singapore for our children – full of opportunities, full of life.

We will also intensify the efforts to attract the best ideas and talent to compete on our side, and complement our strengths. Initiatives like the Global Innovation Alliance connect us with talent hubs across the world. We will make ourselves a more attractive safe harbour for talent, ideas and intellectual property, to grow more businesses and create better jobs. Competition is intense. Talented people, including our own, can go anywhere.

I know many Singaporeans are concerned with foreign competition, but closing ourselves up is not the answer. We cannot escape competing with the world, and proving our mettle. We will give our workers the training and support to excel, and we will ensure that the competition is fair. This is the best way to improve the wellbeing of our people.

Our Businesses and People
Finally, beyond investments in intangibles and infrastructure, this Government will ensure that every member of Team Singapore shares the benefits of growth.

Let me highlight two efforts: digitalisation, and internationalisation.

COVID-19 has pushed many businesses and consumers to embrace the digital world. The digital trajectory will only accelerate, and not reverse. We must enable every Singaporean, young and old; every business, big and small, to go digital and thrive. Companies will embrace digital tools to create new business models and transcend our local market constraints. For example, STB is helping our hospitality companies and event organisers to overcome the collapse in travel demand by using digital tools. One event organiser – WiT or Web In Travel – is engaging global audiences though a virtual travel summit later this month, across different countries.

In the 1980s, we uplifted a generation through computerisation and automation. In the 2020s, we will transform another generation through digitalisation and data, and not just the young in high-tech companies. We are building a thousand-strong Digital Ambassador Corps to help small and micro enterprises apply digitalisation, and help senior citizens to learn to use the technology.

But helping businesses access new markets must go beyond the digital online to establish real partnerships in the real world. Many Singapore businesses have established regional and global presence in the past years, often in partnerships. The more established and larger companies help newcomers and smaller businesses. For example, CapitaLand brings along Singapore companies in its overseas development projects, thus helping them to penetrate new markets. The retail and hospitality sector may be going through a challenging time, but CapitaLand will press on and do more to support our local SMEs.

We will step up such efforts to nurture a new generation of regional and global businesses. We will facilitate more industry partnerships, including in the digital space, like how Singapore E-Biz and Alliance 21 are helping local food manufacturers drive international business. Likewise, we will better organise our overseas Singapore business chapters and missions to guide newcomers venturing overseas.

Our business leaders and workers will be key to these efforts. We must have the aptitude and attitude to serve global markets. Our people must have the entrepreneurial spirit to venture abroad to compete, and seize the opportunities of a fast-growing Asia. We cannot be content with doing well just within Singapore. We introduced Scale-Up SG to groom promising local companies into global champions. So long as our companies have the ambition, we will find the resources to support them.

We will intensify the overseas exposure of our people, through initiatives like the Global Ready Talent Programme, so that they gain fresh perspectives and networks. That is what we did for many students, including Carousell co-founder Siu Rui, Marcus, and Lucas. They spent a year in Silicon Valley, as part of the NUS Overseas Colleges programme. This laid the foundation and gave them the confidence to later launch Carousell, which their team has grown beyond Singapore to eight markets across Southeast Asia today. We will scale up such opportunities for our people.

Earlier this year, MOE announced our ‘70-70’ target to enable more students from institutes of higher learning to gain overseas exposure. 70 per cent of IHL students to have an overseas exposure, 70 per cent to focus on China, India and ASEAN. We will press on with this once the COVID-19 situation allows.

We will never be done upskilling our people. This is especially so for workers who have left school many years ago and did not benefit from the more recent improvements in our education and training system.

Our promise is this: We will create opportunities for all Singaporeans, no matter how old you are, to improve your lives at every stage of your careers. So long as you are able and willing, we will support you. Every Singaporean, regardless of background, can have the chance to take on the new jobs being created.

Confidence for the Future
We can be confident that our investments in our strengths, our infrastructure, and our people are all coming together. This is why in the first four months of this year, EDB has already captured 13 billion dollars of investment commitments, from companies like ExxonMobil, Micron, and ST Microelectronics, and some companies continue to hire and grow their businesses, like Innosparks, Secretlab, and Shopee.

Even though the outlook for the next few years is uncertain, investors maintain their confidence in Singapore to base their new and exciting projects here. For example, Hyundai will be setting up their Mobility Global Innovation Centre in Jurong. It will be a next-generation innovation and manufacturing platform incorporating Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, and robotics to produce electric vehicles of the future. When ready in 2022, it will create many new and exciting opportunities for our workers.

Our local companies are confident too. In my regular visits to our local companies, I have seen many big and small companies in different sectors actively transforming their businesses, such as Prima, Hai Sia Seafood, and Markono Print Media. What cheered me most is that they have upskilled their workforce in the process. They didn’t leave the workers behind.

As you can see, there are still many opportunities for us, but we must be on our toes. Survival favours not the strong, but the agile.

Conclusion
Our Pioneer and Merdeka Generations built our economy from scratch. They laid our strong foundations, brick by brick – Changi Airport, HDB flats, MRT lines, SIA, DBS, PSA and many more. In fact, they moved us from Third World to First in one generation, and saved enough to set aside reserves for future generations.

They showed us what it means to be Singaporean. That while we are not of common ancestry, race, language or religion, we are defined by our determination to chart our own destiny, guided by the values of openness, inclusiveness, self-determination, meritocracy and incorruptibility for us to defy the odds of history, and not only survive but thrive with the world as our hinterland and our markets.

55 years on, we are better positioned to keep Singapore going, growing and glowing. We will build a better Singapore together, where our future generations have the pride, the means, and the gumption to be called Singaporeans.",https://www.gov.sg/article/minister-chan-chun-sing---making-a-living-in-a-covid-19-world
2020-06-17,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,A stronger and more cohesive society,"In this fifth Ministerial broadcast, I will talk about the challenges we face as a society, and how we must work together to strengthen our social compact in the years to come.

The COVID-19 pandemic has raised the stakes. The fall in incomes around the world is expected to be the most severe in the last 100 years. But this is not just an economic recession. It has the makings of a profound social crisis, in one country after another.

We are already seeing this happen elsewhere. It did not begin with the pandemic. Social divisions were already growing in these countries. But they are now getting even wider. Job and income losses have hit some groups much harder than others. Children without well-off parents are falling behind, with their schooling disrupted and little done to help them. 

All this is sharpening feelings of helplessness, and the sense that the system is stacked against those who are already disadvantaged. And it is bringing long-standing perceptions of racial injustice to a boiling point.

Singapore cannot defy the global economic downturn. But we must absolutely defy the loss of social cohesion, the polarisation, and the despair that is taking hold in many other countries.  

Never think these trends cannot take hold in Singapore. There are many societies which used to be cohesive, but are now fragmenting, both in the West and in Asia. No society remains cohesive simply because it used to be. 

The economic dangers we now face compel us to fortify our society, and reinforce the strengths that we have developed over many years. 

Strengthening our Social Compact 
We will redouble efforts to strengthen our social compact. First, we will ensure everyone has full opportunity to do well for themselves, through education, skills, and good jobs. 

Second, we will boost support for those who start life at a disadvantage, so that we keep social mobility alive in Singapore, and lessen inequalities over time. 

And third, we must all play a role to strengthen our culture of solidarity, so we know we have each other to depend on, in good times and bad. 
 
Every individual must put in the effort to achieve their fullest potential. But we must also take responsibility collectively, to help people bounce back from life’s inevitable setbacks, and make sure no Singaporean is left behind.

We are doing this through government policies to help those with less, at every stage of life, as well as through citizen-led initiatives and communities of care that are growing in every neighbourhood. As PM said in his opening broadcast, in Singapore no one will be left to walk his journey alone. 

Tackling Unemployment 
Our first priority today is to save jobs, and to help Singaporeans who do lose their jobs to bounce back into work. This is not just an economic issue, but a social priority. 

We will do all we can to prevent people from being out of work for long, so they can stand on their own feet and retain their sense of dignity. Good jobs are also at the heart of our whole approach to building a cohesive society and tempering inequalities. 

The National Jobs Council is moving full speed ahead. We will secure the 100,000 jobs and training places targeted by the SGUnited Jobs and Skills package that DPM Heng Swee Keat introduced. 

The reality of the matter is that we face strong headwinds. As long as grave uncertainty hangs over the global economy, and trade and travel are down, new job openings in Singapore will very likely be fewer than job losses. 

So if we leave things to market forces, unemployment will rise significantly over the next year, or even beyond that if COVID-19 remains a threat. 

We are therefore working with companies, sector by sector, to take on Singaporeans through temporary assignments, attachments and traineeships during this down period, so they get real work opportunities and get paid, and pick up skills while waiting for permanent jobs to open up.

The Government is heavily subsidising these opportunities. It gives people far greater benefit when Government provides support this way. No amount of unemployment allowances can compensate for the demoralisation of being out of work for long. 

The public sector will also bring forward hiring for future jobs, in areas such as healthcare, early childhood development, education and social services. It will step up recruitment especially in sectors which earlier had difficulty finding enough Singaporeans to fill up the positions. 

We have faced conditions of high unemployment before, but we are in a much stronger position to address the challenge today. Twice before, unemployment rose well beyond 6% - In the late 60s, when the British began pulling out their forces, and in the mid-80s, when we suffered a major recession. 

Our economy is much better diversified today. Our people are far more skilled. And the trust and confidence that investors have in Singapore is much stronger, as Minister Chan Chun Sing explained in the last Ministerial broadcast. 

Helping our Middle-Aged and Mature Workers 
However, our labour force is much older today than in the late 60s when the British began pulling out, and in the mid-80s recession. In those times, less than 30% of our labour force was 40 years or older. Today, the proportion is 60%, double what it was before. And many of today’s workers are in fact 50 years or older. 

This is why we are making a concerted effort to help our middle-aged and mature Singaporean workers. Most of those in their 50s and 60s did not go beyond secondary school. They had much fewer educational opportunities than today’s younger generation. But they are a hard-working and vigorous generation, who have accumulated valuable skills and experience over the years, and still have many good years ahead of them.

We will spare no effort to help them carry on with their careers in the most productive jobs they can do, so that they can continue to provide for their families and contribute to Singapore. 

The Government will give employers extra support when they hire middle-aged and older Singaporeans. We will also scale up the new Mid-Career Pathways programme in the months to come, so they get opportunities to work at companies and public sector agencies, and can prepare for more permanent jobs in future. 

This is, and must be, a national effort. And it needs new thinking among employers, to give middle-aged and mature Singaporean workers a fair chance to prove themselves. Employers need to reorient their management philosophies, and their HR and talent management practices. 

No Singaporean who is willing to learn should be ‘too old’ to hire. And no one who is willing to adapt should be viewed as ‘overqualified’. We will work closely with the business associations to bring all employers into this national effort. MOM will also watch companies’ hiring practices to ensure they comply with the Fair Consideration Framework. 

If it becomes the norm to hire mid-career Singaporeans and train them for new jobs, everyone is better off. Our workers will be able to build on their skills and experience and we will have a more capable and motivated workforce, with a strong Singaporean core, that every employer can rely on. 

The Future of Jobs Begins Now 
We are also investing heavily in reskilling and upskilling the majority of Singaporeans who still have jobs. 

Many occupations are being transformed by the digital revolution and other technological advances. We have been preparing for this for several years. 

But COVID-19 is fast-forwarding the changes. When we talk of the jobs of the future, therefore, it is not some far-off or hypothetical possibility. The future begins now. 

That is why we have expanded training opportunities in every sector and every job, through the Next Bound of SkillsFuture, like here at e2i. 
 
Everyone should have the courage to re-gear to stay on track, and make the effort to acquire new skills at regular points in your careers, possibly even learning whole new disciplines. Please take on the challenge.

Keeping Social Mobility Alive
These efforts will not only give Singaporeans good jobs, but also help with social mobility. When everyone keeps learning throughout life, they can advance through the skills and mastery they acquire rather than grades earned long ago in school. We are progressively developing this meritocracy of life.

But good schools are critical to social mobility too.

Social mobility is what Singapore has been about, and how we have transformed our society since the 1960s. Generations of children from humble backgrounds have moved up in life, through education, and by working hard in their jobs and businesses.

Even today, Singaporeans who grow up in lower income families have a better chance of moving up the income ladder than those in most other advanced countries.

We must never become a society where social pedigree and connections count for more than ability and effort.

However, there is nothing natural or pre-ordained about social mobility. Every successful country has in fact found that it gets more difficult to sustain this with time. Parents who themselves had higher education or who have become better off are investing more in their children, and moving them further ahead of the rest.

 It therefore requires relentless government effort, quality interventions in schools, and dedicated networks of community support to keep social mobility alive.  
 - Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam
We are investing a lot more into equalising opportunities when children are young. We are expanding KidStart, to help lower income families and their children in the earliest years, which are critical to their development. And we have upgraded the preschool profession, and set up the National Institute of Early Childhood Development to raise standards. So whichever preschool your child goes to, he or she will have a good start.

We are also investing more in our schools, to make sure that every student who needs extra support will get it. During the recent circuit-breaker, our teachers made great effort to help students from poorer homes and those at risk, to ensure they did not fall behind.

But it is also an ongoing, broader effort. MOE has been allocating extra resources to schools for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. We will give them even more support in the coming years, by hiring more teachers, allied educators, student welfare officers, and teacher-counsellors.

They will strengthen the school teams that support students who are doing less well in primary schools, and our UPLIFT efforts to help those at risk. And they will help students to go as far as they can through the Full Subject-Based Banding system in secondary schools.

Minister Ong Ye Kung is also accelerating plans to equip all secondary school students with a personal laptop or tablet for learning. They will each have their own device by next year, seven years ahead of the original target.

When you add up all we are doing, starting from the earliest years of childhood, we are making a determined effort to keep Singapore a place where every individual can do well, regardless of their starting points.

Building a Stronger Culture of Solidarity
Finally, we must strengthen our culture of solidarity, and provide Singaporeans with greater assurance of assistance when they meet with difficulties in life.

We must remain a society where self-effort is rewarded, and each one of us takes pride in achieving something in life. But we also need, more than we did in the earlier years, a strong spirit of selflessness and solidarity, looking out for the vulnerable, and supporting each other. Not because we are obliged to do so, but because it makes us a better society together.

We have seen this solidarity in action in the COVID-19 crisis. Singaporeans from all walks of life have come forward to support those who were most affected by the crisis, including by serving on the frontlines.

These community efforts have complemented the Government’s social support schemes to help Singaporeans through the crisis. They are schemes responding to today’s crisis, but they are also part of a broader re-orientation in our social policies, that began well before COVID-19, and will outlast it. We are working systematically to provide greater support for lower and middle-income Singaporeans and to build a fair and just society.

We will strengthen these policies in the coming years. No one can tell what world will emerge when COVID-19 is over, or whether it has entered a long period of economic stagnation as many fear. But we will do all we can to make ours a more cohesive society, and do it in ways that can be sustained into the next generation. And we must all do our utmost to avoid the rifts and fractures that we see developing in many other societies.

The Government has increased subsidies for lower and middle-income families in education, housing and healthcare, including CHAS. We are also boosting Silver Support, to help our poorer retirees.

But very importantly, we continue to strengthen support for our lower income Singaporeans at work. Through Workfare and the Special Employment Credit, the Government pays as much as 40% on top of the wages that employers pay older lower-income workers.

We are also making progress in uplifting our lowest paid workers, and will go further. Through the Progressive Wage Model (PWM), our cleaners, security officers and landscape workers have seen their wages increase by 30% in real terms over the last 5 years. That is not the end of it. Progressive Wages are not a one-off, but a ladder for continuing improvement.

In time, we want every sector to have Progressive Wages, with this clear ladder of skills, better jobs, and better wages for those with lower pay. Minister Josephine Teo at MOM is working actively with the tripartite partners on this. They will bring in the industry associations, to work out schemes that can be practically adopted in the different industries.

Likewise, we want to provide lower-income Singaporeans in short-term contract work with opportunities to get more stable jobs, better protection and the chance to progress in their careers.

These measures will bring meaningful and continuing improvements in pay and conditions for our lower-income workers. It may lead to a small rise in the cost of services that we all pay for. But it is a small price for us to pay for better jobs and income security for those who need it most, and a fair society.

Our Confidence in the Future
Ultimately, the greatest confidence we get in our future as Singaporeans comes from our social compact. Our social strategies are aimed at strengthening this compact that holds us together. But the compact is about all of us, and goes much deeper than Government policies.

It is about the compact of self-effort and selflessness that we must strengthen in our culture. It is about the networks and initiatives that we saw spring up in this COVID-19 crisis.

About the interest we take in each other, at workplaces and in the community, because we all make up the fabric of Singapore. About respecting every individual regardless of their job, and respecting their effort to overcome setbacks and make the best they can of life. And it is about how we draw closer to each other, regardless of race, religion or social background.

It is how we journey together. A forward-looking, spirited and more cohesive society.",https://www.gov.sg/article/senior-minister-tharman-shanmugaratnam-a-stronger-and-more-cohesive-society
2020-06-20,Heng Swee Keat,Emerging Stronger Together,"These last few months have been difficult for everyone. We could not celebrate Easter, Vesak Day, Hari Raya Puasa and Mother’s Day like we usually do. I know many of you are happy that we can have small gatherings for Father’s Day tomorrow. Happy Father’s Day! 

It was not an easy decision to impose the circuit breaker, but we had to do it to protect lives. We all had to make sacrifices. Let me express our heartfelt appreciation to our brave healthcare and frontline workers for working tirelessly to keep us safe. Our thanks also to the many others who worked behind the scenes to keep our essential services going. Because of your sacrifices and hard work, COVID-19 is under control, and we are now able to resume a large part of our daily lives. Thank you.

Let us continue to stay vigilant. The pandemic is still raging around the world, with more than 8 million infected so far. The reopening of countries has surfaced new waves of infections. And the global economy is headed for its deepest downturn since the Great Depression. Our way of life, our livelihoods and our future are at stake. When will the crisis end? Nobody can be sure.

There is profound uncertainty – about how the pandemic will evolve, and how our livelihoods will be disrupted. I understand your anxiety. Some ask: Will I lose my job? And if I lose my job, can I find a new job? Will our children still have a bright future? Will my business survive?

Facing the crisis of our generation
PM Lee called this “the crisis of a generation”. Indeed, this is our worst economic contraction in decades. We experienced record decline in the number of people employed in the first quarter of this year. I never expected to put up four Budgets, one after another, within just 100 days. Never before in our history have we done so. We have committed almost 100 billion dollars, with more than half from our Past Reserves. 

We are mounting a robust response. Had we not done so, we would have lost years of progress and an entire generation. We are very grateful to our past generations, whose blood, sweat and tears left us with these deep financial reserves. So let us remember – once we have recovered from this crisis, our generation must build back better.

Over the past two weeks, you have heard PM and my colleagues lay out what we stand for, and our plans – how to deal with the virus, navigate a more fractious world, build our economic strength, create opportunities for all, deepen our social compact, and care for the vulnerable. This is our promise: We shall not only overcome this crisis. We will emerge from it stronger – as an economy, as a society, and as a people. 

Emerging Stronger Together
COVID-19 will reshape the world. Ministers Kim Yong and Lawrence are leading our national efforts to battle this pandemic. We must learn to live with this virus for some time. The global economy and geopolitics will change, faster than ever. 

To emerge stronger, we must draw on the wits and will of our people. When we launched the Singapore Together movement a year ago, I promised that we would partner with Singaporeans to shape our future together. Now, in this crisis, partnership is more critical than ever. Together, we will take decisive action to support every Singaporean to emerge stronger from this crisis. Our economy will emerge stronger, creating better jobs and business opportunities for all Singaporeans. And our society will emerge stronger, leaving no one to walk this journey alone. We will emerge stronger as one people, our sense of identity and values renewed. 

Supporting Every Singaporean
Our most urgent task now is jobs. Your job is our top priority. Because jobs are the most direct way for every Singaporean to improve our lives and support our loved ones. As our Labour Movement puts it, “A job is the best welfare for our people”. We are doing our best to keep viable businesses afloat, helping them hold on to their workers for as long as possible, so that you can preserve your livelihoods. 

The pandemic has hit some harder than others. So we are providing more support to cushion the impact for those hardest-hit. For example, for our workers who have lost their jobs or a large part of their income, the COVID-19 Support Grant helps with their immediate needs. This is the first time that we are extending direct cash support to self-employed workers on a large scale. We are paying special attention to our lower-wage workers. Workfare recipients will soon get an additional special payment to tide them through the crisis. Beyond that, we will work with employers and unions to enhance their career prospects. 

Emerging Stronger as an Economy
But despite our utmost efforts, some – perhaps even many – will lose their jobs. We are therefore making a big push to create as many new jobs as possible. The National Jobs Council has started work, to oversee the creation of 100,000 jobs and training opportunities under the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package. We will work with companies, and invest in our people.

We are determined not to lose a generation of workers and youths. We will need a stronger economy – dynamic and inclusive, resilient and innovative, connected to new global nodes in Asia and the world – so that we can create more jobs offering better prospects for workers, and our workers can climb higher up the skills ladder. 

This is what distinguishes us from other countries. All countries, including us, are providing immediate support, to provide a cushion. But we are going further, investing to give everyone a springboard, to bounce back from this even stronger. In Singapore, we never stop thinking of tomorrow.

To succeed, we need to master the major trends reshaping the global economy, and speed up the structural transformation of our economy. With COVID-19, resilience and reliability will be more valued, Asia is likely to remain a bright spot. The shift to digital will accelerate. The way we live and work will be transformed. We must support our businesses and workers to ride on these trends, and reimagine our economy for a post-COVID-19 future. 

And we will do so in three ways. One, we are a major trading nation, and a key aviation and maritime hub, committed to the free flow of goods, services, capital, data, ideas and talent. In a more fractious post-COVID-19 world, whatever the rest of the world does, we will persist to find new links to enable these flows, especially in connecting critical supply lines around the world. Do not doubt this: Singapore must always remain an open, trading nation. We are finished if we close up.

Two, we will continue investing in our infrastructure, even if we need to delay some projects. Such projects keep us connected to the world, makes travelling within Singapore faster and more pleasant, and gives us all beautiful homes. We will strengthen our resilience, such as through our “30 by 30” food production plan, which Minister Masagos is overseeing. We will also rejuvenate our island into a cleaner and greener Singapore, and a city in nature for our people to enjoy.

Three, our investments in research and innovation will sharpen our competitiveness. We are finalising our R&D plan for the next five years. We will set aside over 20 billion dollars to support basic and applied research in high impact areas, such as health and biomedical sciences, climate change, and artificial intelligence. We will launch a series of Innovation Challenges to rally our people to pioneer solutions for some of the world’s major challenges.

Singapore continues to be one of the most competitive economies in the world. Thankfully, we started transforming for the future economy five years ago. Our businesses and unions partnered the Government to develop and implement Industry Transformation Maps for each industry. Minister Chun Sing outlined how our transformation is progressing well, and how we will press on.

To make the most of new opportunities in the post-COVID-19 world, we set up the Emerging Stronger Taskforce in May. The Taskforce is consulting widely, and involving people from a wide spectrum of society, while putting ideas into action quickly. For a start, we will set up “Singapore Together Alliances for Action”. These Alliances will be led by industry, with each prototyping new ideas within the coming months, in areas such as robotics, e-commerce, environmental sustainability, digitalisation of supply chains and the built environment. The key is speed and agility. Successful projects will become new shoots of growth, and generate new jobs.

This effort to grow our economy is not just to create jobs, but to create better jobs for Singaporeans. Ministers Josephine, Chee Meng and Ye Kung are working hard to make this happen. We will better prepare you to take on these jobs through the SkillsFuture movement. We will also continue to strengthen our education system, to keep ‘every school a good school’, and to create multiple pathways to success. This is how we will keep the promise of progress alive for all.

Emerging Stronger as a Society
As we build a stronger economy, we must also strengthen our society. To ensure that no Singaporean is left behind, we must strengthen our culture of solidarity, as Senior Minister Tharman says.

The circuit breaker has revealed vulnerabilities in our midst. Some of our seniors found it hard to use digital tools and services. So Minister Iswaran launched the Seniors Go Digital programme, working with community partners, to help our seniors bridge the digital divide.

We must also reach out to those who cannot quite cope with new stresses. To provide emotional and psychological support, we launched the National Care Hotline, with help from many volunteers. The Government will continue to support you fully, and mobilise Singaporeans to support one another. Ministers Grace, Indranee and Desmond will oversee these efforts. Be assured that, in Singapore, no one will be left to walk alone. You will be cared for if you fall on hard times. You will be part of our society’s progress, no matter your starting point or circumstances.

COVID-19 has sharpened our sense of purpose, and brought us closer together as a society. We want to hear how the crisis has impacted you, and how we can work together on your ideas to take Singapore forward. So we have started a series of Emerging Stronger Conversations. True to the spirit of Singapore Together, these conversations will lead to action. We will set up Singapore Together Action Networks – to bring together partners across different sectors, and turn ideas into new solutions. We have already begun forming these networks, such as the Youth Mental Well-being Network, UPLIFT and the SG Cares Community Care Network. We will form new partnerships around issues that you care about, and to make a difference through action.

Emerging Stronger as One People
At the first Emerging Stronger Conversation a few days back, someone asked, “What will Singapore and Singaporeans be known for in the world?” We can see the answer around us. Our school children sending messages to encourage our healthcare and frontline workers. Our social agencies, charities, youths and volunteers supporting our vulnerable – lonely seniors, persons with special needs, and migrant workers. Our religious groups praying in new ways, to keep everyone safe, and supporting people with needs. Our businesses returning funding for the Jobs Support Scheme because they are doing well, and are rewarding their workers, and making contributions to social causes. We see Singaporeans from all walks of life, trusting in and caring for one another.

Let us build on this. Let us collect the stories of kindness and courage, the stories of everyday heroes, and tell and retell them. Let our children reflect and deepen our “values in action”, so that they grow up united and resilient, and go forward in solidarity and with fortitude.

In the worst of times, we see the best in our people. We commemorated our Bicentennial last year. Across 200 years of sweeping change, we grew from Singapore to Singaporeans. Today, less than 200 days into what will be a long-drawn fight, we are again showing the world who we are. We care for one another, we are generous and resilient, and we will not hesitate to make sacrifices for the greater good. These shared experiences will be etched in our collective memories.

Above all, as Senior Minister Teo reminded us, the stronger we are at home – as an economy, as a society, as one people – the more secure our place in the world. Our strengths at home will enable us to be a valuable member in the community of nations. Minister Vivian and his team will continue to keep the Singapore flag flying high.

We can play a useful role in the regional and global community – in trade, innovation, rule of law, action on climate change, or pandemic management. A trusted and reliable Singapore, relevant to the world, will in turn attract investments into Singapore. And give Singaporeans an edge in seeking opportunities at home or abroad.  This Singapore premium is precious.

A democracy of deeds, a society in action, one people working in unison, confident of our place in the world – this is Singapore Together. I invite all Singaporeans and friends of Singapore to join us in this effort.

Conclusion
Through this series of broadcasts, you have heard PM and my colleagues lay out our plans. We are committed to growing our economy and protecting jobs, strengthening our society, and safeguarding everything we hold dear.

Our journey ahead is long, and our actions in the next five to ten years will chart the course of our nation for decades to come. Where there are winds of change, we must find new waves of opportunity. Each of us must adapt and learn fast in this changed world, turn anxiety to action, turn challenges to opportunities. As we move forward, we will deepen our trust and support for one another.

I have every confidence that we will succeed. This Government has the will and the way to lead us out of this crisis. We will face the challenges ahead together with you, all the way. We will fight COVID-19 as Singapore Together. Everyone counts, and can be counted on. We will do what it takes to protect our lives and our livelihoods, to secure our future. We will overcome this crisis of our generation. We will be a generation that emerges stronger. Together, we will be the generation that sets our children and their children onto a path to an even brighter future!",https://www.pmo.gov.sg/Newsroom/National-Broadcast-by-DPM-Heng-Swee-Keat-on-20-June-2020
